  Watson Orders is an IBM Silicon Valley based technology development group
  targeting the development of world-class conversational AI. This posts walks
  through the process of migrating off Bazel, where they maintained 19,000 lines
  of BUILD file metadata, to Pants where that was slashed to 2,400 lines thanks
  to [dependency
  inference](/docs/introduction/how-does-pants-work#dependency-inference). CI
  build time for PRs dropped from 10-12 minutes with Bazel to under 4 minutes
  with Pants.

  > ...We found it incredibly easy to hook in our existing remote caching
  systems to Pants, and added other nice features like running tailor in a
  check-only mode to highlight any inconsistencies in our repo. As a side
  benefit, Pants has helped us gain better insight into our repository by being
  able to easily scan for and report the transitive dependencies of modules.
  Having that insight has helped us plan out how to minimize the coupling of our
  modules...
