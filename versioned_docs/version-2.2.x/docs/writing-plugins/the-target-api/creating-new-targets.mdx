How to add a custom target type.

---

## When to create a new target type?

Adding new target types is most helpful when you are adding support for a new language.

If you instead want to reduce boilerplate in BUILD files, such as changing default values, use [macros](../macros.mdx) .

If you are already using a target type, but need to store additional metadata for your plugin, [add a new field to the target type](./extending-pre-existing-targets.mdx).

## Step 1: Define the target type

To define a new target:

1. Subclass `pants.engine.target.Target`.
2. Define the class property `alias`. This is the symbol that people use in BUILD files.
3. Define the class property `core_fields`.
4. Define the class property `help`. This is used by `./pants help`.

For `core_fields`, we recommend including `COMMON_TARGET_FIELDS` to add the useful `tags` and `description` fields. You will also often want to add `Dependencies` and/or `Sources`.

```python title="plugins/target_types.py"
from pants.engine.target import (
    COMMON_TARGET_FIELDS,
    Dependencies,
    Sources,
    StringField,
    Target,
)


class CustomField(StringField):
    alias = "custom_field"
    help = "A custom field."


class CustomTarget(Target):
    alias = "custom_target"
    core_fields = (*COMMON_TARGET_FIELDS, Dependencies, Sources, CustomField)
    help = (
      "A custom target to demo the Target API.\n\n"
      "This docstring will be used in the output of "
      "`./pants help $target_type`."
    )
```

:::note Tip: subclass the `Sources` field
You will usually want to subclass the `Sources` field to give custom functionality, such as setting a default value.

You can also set the class property `expected_file_extensions` to enforce that only certain files are used, such as `expected_file_extensions = (".json", ".txt")`.
:::

:::note Using the fields of a pre-existing target type
Sometimes, you may want to create a new target type that behaves similarly to one that already exists, except for some small changes.

For example, you might like how `python_binary()` behaves in general, but you have a Django application and keep writing `sources=["manage.py"]`. Normally, you should write a [macro](../macros.mdx) to set this default value; but, here, you also want to add new Django-specific fields, so you decide to create a new target type.

Rather than subclassing the original target type, use this pattern:

```python
from pants.backend.python.target_types import PythonBinary, PythonBinarySources
from pants.engine.target import Target
from pants.util.ordered_set import FrozenOrderedSet

class DjangoManagePySources(PythonBinarySources):
   default = ("manage.py",)


class DjangoManagePy(Target):
   alias = "django_manage_py"
   core_fields = (
       *(FrozenOrderedSet(PythonBinary.core_fields) - {PythonBinarySources}),
       DjangoManagePySources,
   )
```

In this example, we register all of the fields of `PythonBinary`, except for the field `PythonBinarySources`. We instead register our custom field `DjangoManagePySources`.
:::

## Step 2: Register the target type in `register.py`

Now, in your [`register.py`](../overview.mdx), add the target type to the `def target_types()` entry point.

```python title="plugins/register.py"
from plugins.target_types import CustomTarget

def target_types():
    return [CustomTarget]
```

You can confirm this works by running `./pants help custom_target`.
