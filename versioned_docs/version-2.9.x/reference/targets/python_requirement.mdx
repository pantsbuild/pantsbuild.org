---

A Python requirement installable by pip.

This target is useful when you want to declare Python requirements inline in a BUILD file. If you have a `requirements.txt` file already, you can instead use the macro `python_requirements()` to convert each requirement into a `python_requirement()` target automatically. For Poetry, use `poetry_requirements()`.

See https://www.pantsbuild.org/v2.9/docs/python-third-party-dependencies.

## `tags`

<Field
    type_repr={`field.type_hint`}
>

Arbitrary strings to describe a target.

For example, you may tag some test targets with &#x27;integration_test&#x27; so that you could run `./pants --tag='integration_test' test ::` to only run on targets with that tag.

</Field>

## `description`

<Field
    type_repr={`field.type_hint`}
>

A human-readable description of the target.

Use `./pants list --documented ::` to see all targets with descriptions.

</Field>

## `dependencies`

<Field
    type_repr={`field.type_hint`}
>

Addresses to other targets that this target depends on, e.g. [&#x27;helloworld/subdir:lib&#x27;, &#x27;helloworld/main.py:lib&#x27;, &#x27;3rdparty:reqs#django&#x27;].

This augments any dependencies inferred by Pants, such as by analyzing your imports. Use `./pants dependencies` or `./pants peek` on this target to get the final result.

See https://www.pantsbuild.org/v2.9/docs/targets#target-addresses and https://www.pantsbuild.org/v2.9/docs/targets#target-generation for more about how addresses are formed, including for generated targets. You can also run `./pants list ::` to find all addresses in your project, or `./pants list dir:` to find all addresses defined in that directory.

If the target is in the same BUILD file, you can leave off the BUILD file path, e.g. `:tgt` instead of `helloworld/subdir:tgt`. For generated first-party addresses, use `./` for the file path, e.g. `./main.py:tgt`; for all other generated targets, use `:tgt#generated_name`.

You may exclude dependencies by prefixing with `!`, e.g. `['!helloworld/subdir:lib', '!./sibling.txt']`. Ignores are intended for false positives with dependency inference; otherwise, simply leave off the dependency from the BUILD file.

</Field>

## `requirements`

<Field
    type_repr={`field.type_hint`}
>

A pip-style requirement string, e.g. `["Django==3.2.8"]`.

You can specify multiple requirements for the same project in order to use environment markers, such as `["foo>=1.2,<1.3 ; python_version>'3.6'", "foo==0.9 ; python_version<'3'"]`.

If the requirement depends on some other requirement to work, such as needing `setuptools` to be built, use the `dependencies` field instead.

</Field>

## `modules`

<Field
    type_repr={`field.type_hint`}
>

The modules this requirement provides (used for dependency inference).

For example, the requirement `setuptools` provides `["setuptools", "pkg_resources", "easy_install"]`.

Usually you can leave this field off. If unspecified, Pants will first look at the default module mapping (https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/blob/release_2.9.2/src/python/pants/backend/python/dependency_inference/default_module_mapping.py), and then will default to the normalized project name. For example, the requirement `Django` would default to the module `django`.

Mutually exclusive with the `type_stub_modules` field.

</Field>

## `type_stub_modules`

<Field
    type_repr={`field.type_hint`}
>

The modules this requirement provides if the requirement is a type stub (used for dependency inference).

For example, the requirement `types-requests` provides `["requests"]`.

Usually you can leave this field off. If unspecified, Pants will first look at the default module mapping (https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/blob/release_2.9.2/src/python/pants/backend/python/dependency_inference/default_module_mapping.py). If not found _and_ the requirement name starts with `types-` or `stubs-`, or ends with `-types` or `-stubs`, will default to that requirement name without the prefix/suffix. For example, `types-requests` would default to `requests`. Otherwise, will be treated like a normal requirement (see the `modules` field).

Mutually exclusive with the `modules` field.
