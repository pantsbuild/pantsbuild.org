## Basic options

### `skip`

<Option
  cli_repr={`--[no-]mypy-skip`}
  env_repr='PANTS_MYPY_SKIP'
  default_repr={`False`}
>

If true, don&#x27;t use MyPy when running `scie-pants-linux-x86_64 check`.

</Option>

### `args`

<Option
  cli_repr={`--mypy-args="[<shell_str>, <shell_str>, ...]"`}
  env_repr='PANTS_MYPY_ARGS'
  default_repr={`[]`}
>

Arguments to pass directly to MyPy, e.g. `--mypy-args='--python-version 3.7 --disallow-any-expr'`.

</Option>

## Advanced options

### `install_from_resolve`

<Option
  cli_repr={`--mypy-install-from-resolve=<str>`}
  env_repr='PANTS_MYPY_INSTALL_FROM_RESOLVE'
  default_repr={`None`}
>

If specified, install the tool using the lockfile for this named resolve.

This resolve must be defined in [python].resolves, as described in https://www.pantsbuild.org/v2.17/docs/python-third-party-dependencies#user-lockfiles.

The resolve&#x27;s entire lockfile will be installed, unless specific requirements are listed via the `requirements` option, in which case only those requirements will be installed. This is useful if you don&#x27;t want to invalidate the tool&#x27;s outputs when the resolve incurs changes to unrelated requirements.

If unspecified, and the `lockfile` option is unset, the tool will be installed using the default lockfile shipped with Pants.

If unspecified, and the `lockfile` option is set, the tool will use the custom `mypy` &quot;tool lockfile&quot; generated from the `version` and `extra_requirements` options. But note that this mechanism is deprecated.

</Option>

### `requirements`

<Option
  cli_repr={`--mypy-requirements="['<str>', '<str>', ...]"`}
  env_repr='PANTS_MYPY_REQUIREMENTS'
  default_repr={`[]`}
>

If install_from_resolve is specified, install these requirements, at the versions provided by the specified resolve&#x27;s lockfile.

Values can be pip-style requirements (e.g., `tool` or `tool==1.2.3` or `tool>=1.2.3`), or addresses of python_requirement targets (or targets that generate or depend on python_requirement targets).

The lockfile will be validated against the requirements - if a lockfile doesn&#x27;t provide the requirement (at a suitable version, if the requirement specifies version constraints) Pants will error.

If unspecified, install the entire lockfile.

</Option>

### `interpreter_constraints`

<Option
  cli_repr={`--mypy-interpreter-constraints="['<str>', '<str>', ...]"`}
  env_repr='PANTS_MYPY_INTERPRETER_CONSTRAINTS'
  default_repr={`["CPython>=3.7,<4"]`}
>

Python interpreter constraints for this tool.

</Option>

### `console_script`

<Option
  cli_repr={`--mypy-console-script=<str>`}
  env_repr='PANTS_MYPY_CONSOLE_SCRIPT'
  default_repr={`mypy`}
>

The console script for the tool. Using this option is generally preferable to (and mutually exclusive with) specifying an --entry-point since console script names have a higher expectation of staying stable across releases of the tool. Usually, you will not want to change this from the default.

</Option>

### `entry_point`

<Option
  cli_repr={`--mypy-entry-point=<str>`}
  env_repr='PANTS_MYPY_ENTRY_POINT'
  default_repr={`None`}
>

The entry point for the tool. Generally you only want to use this option if the tool does not offer a --console-script (which this option is mutually exclusive with). Usually, you will not want to change this from the default.

</Option>

### `config`

<Option
  cli_repr={`--mypy-config=<file_option>`}
  env_repr='PANTS_MYPY_CONFIG'
  default_repr={`None`}
>

Path to a config file understood by MyPy (https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config_file.html).

Setting this option will disable `[mypy].config_discovery`. Use this option if the config is located in a non-standard location.

</Option>

### `config_discovery`

<Option
  cli_repr={`--[no-]mypy-config-discovery`}
  env_repr='PANTS_MYPY_CONFIG_DISCOVERY'
  default_repr={`True`}
>

If true, Pants will include any relevant config files during runs (`mypy.ini`, `.mypy.ini`, and `setup.cfg`).

Use `[mypy].config` instead if your config is in a non-standard location.

</Option>

### `source_plugins`

<Option
  cli_repr={`--mypy-source-plugins="[<target_option>, <target_option>, ...]"`}
  env_repr='PANTS_MYPY_SOURCE_PLUGINS'
  default_repr={`[]`}
>

An optional list of `python_sources` target addresses to load first-party plugins.

You must also set `plugins = path.to.module` in your `mypy.ini`, and set the `[mypy].config` option in your `pants.toml`.

To instead load third-party plugins, set the option `[mypy].extra_requirements` and set the `plugins` option in `mypy.ini`. Tip: it&#x27;s often helpful to define a dedicated &#x27;resolve&#x27; via `[python].resolves` for your MyPy plugins such as &#x27;mypy-plugins&#x27; so that the third-party requirements used by your plugin, like `mypy`, do not mix with the rest of your project. Read that option&#x27;s help message for more info on resolves.

</Option>

## Deprecated options

### `version`

<Option
  cli_repr={`--mypy-version=<str>`}
  env_repr='PANTS_MYPY_VERSION'
  default_repr={`mypy==1.1.1`}
  removal_version='2.18.0.dev1'
  removal_hint={'Custom tool versions are now installed from named resolves, as described at https://www.pantsbuild.org/v2.17/docs/python-lockfiles.'}
>

Requirement string for the tool.

</Option>

### `extra_requirements`

<Option
  cli_repr={`--mypy-extra-requirements="['<str>', '<str>', ...]"`}
  env_repr='PANTS_MYPY_EXTRA_REQUIREMENTS'
  default_repr={`[]`}
  removal_version='2.18.0.dev1'
  removal_hint={'Custom tool versions are now installed from named resolves, as described at https://www.pantsbuild.org/v2.17/docs/python-lockfiles.'}
>

Any additional requirement strings to use with the tool. This is useful if the tool allows you to install plugins or if you need to constrain a dependency to a certain version.

</Option>

### `lockfile`

<Option
  cli_repr={`--mypy-lockfile=<str>`}
  env_repr='PANTS_MYPY_LOCKFILE'
  default_repr={`<default>`}
  removal_version='2.18.0.dev0'
  removal_hint={'Custom tool versions are now installed from named resolves, as described at https://www.pantsbuild.org/v2.17/docs/python-lockfiles.<br /><br />1. If you have an existing resolve that includes the requirements for this tool,<br />    you can set `[mypy].install_from_resolve = "<resolve name>".<br />    This may be the case if the tool also provides a runtime library, and you want<br />    to specify the version in just one place.<br />2. If not, you can set up a new resolve as described at the link above.<br /><br />Either way, the resolve you choose should provide the requirements currently set by the `version` and `extra-requirements` options for this tool, which you can see by running `pants help-advanced mypy`.'}
>

Path to a lockfile used for installing the tool.

Set to the string `<default>` to use a lockfile provided by Pants, so long as you have not changed the `--version` and `--extra-requirements` options, and the tool&#x27;s interpreter constraints are compatible with the default. Pants will error or warn if the lockfile is not compatible (controlled by `[python].invalid_lockfile_behavior`). See https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/blob/release_2.17.1rc3/src/python/pants/backend/python/typecheck/mypy/mypy.lock for the default lockfile contents.

To use a custom lockfile, set this option to a file path relative to the build root, then run `scie-pants-linux-x86_64 generate-lockfiles --resolve=mypy`.

Alternatively, you can set this option to the path to a custom lockfile using pip&#x27;s requirements.txt-style, ideally with `--hash`. Set `[python].invalid_lockfile_behavior = 'ignore'` so that Pants does not complain about missing lockfile headers.

</Option>

### `export`

<Option
  cli_repr={`--[no-]mypy-export`}
  env_repr='PANTS_MYPY_EXPORT'
  default_repr={`True`}
  removal_version='2.18.0.dev0'
  removal_hint={'Use the export goal\'s --resolve option to select tools to export, instead of using this option to exempt a tool from export-by-default.'}
>

If true, export a virtual environment with MyPy when running `scie-pants-linux-x86_64 export`.

This can be useful, for example, with IDE integrations to point your editor to the tool&#x27;s binary.

</Option>

### `extra_type_stubs`

<Option
  cli_repr={`--mypy-extra-type-stubs="['<str>', '<str>', ...]"`}
  env_repr='PANTS_MYPY_EXTRA_TYPE_STUBS'
  default_repr={`[]`}
  removal_version='2.18.0dev0'
  removal_hint={'Extra type stubs are now installed from a named resolve, as described at https://www.pantsbuild.org/v2.17/docs/python-lockfiles.'}
>

Extra type stub requirements to install when running MyPy.

Normally, type stubs can be installed as typical requirements, such as putting them in `requirements.txt` or using a `python_requirement` target. Alternatively, you can use this option so that the dependencies are solely used when running MyPy and are not runtime dependencies.

NOTE: Dependencies specified in this way are not visible to dependency inference, and cannot be referenced as explicit dependencies. See https://www.pantsbuild.org/v2.17/docs/python-check-goal for more information about problems this can cause, and how to work around them.

Expects a list of pip-style requirement strings, like `['types-requests==2.25.9']`.

We recommend also enabling `[mypy].extra_type_stubs_lockfile` for a more reproducible build and less supply-chain security risk.

</Option>

### `extra_type_stubs_lockfile`

<Option
  cli_repr={`--mypy-extra-type-stubs-lockfile=<str>`}
  env_repr='PANTS_MYPY_EXTRA_TYPE_STUBS_LOCKFILE'
  default_repr={`<none>`}
  removal_version='2.18.0dev0'
  removal_hint={'Extra type stubs are now installed from a named resolve, as described at https://www.pantsbuild.org/v2.17/docs/python-lockfiles.'}
>

Path to a lockfile for the option `[mypy].extra_type_stubs`.

Set to the string `<none>` to opt out of using a lockfile. We do not recommend this if you use `[mypy].extra_type_stubs`, though, as lockfiles are essential for reproducible builds and supply-chain security.

To use a lockfile, set this option to a file path relative to the build root, then run `scie-pants-linux-x86_64 generate-lockfiles --resolve=mypy-extra-type-stubs`.
