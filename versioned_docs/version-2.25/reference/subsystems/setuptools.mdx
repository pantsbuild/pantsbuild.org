Python setuptools, used to package `python_distribution` targets.

This version of Pants uses `setuptools` version 74.1.2 by default. Use a dedicated lockfile and the `install_from_resolve` option to control this.

### `install_from_resolve`

<Option
  cli_repr={`--setuptools-install-from-resolve=<str>`}
  env_repr='PANTS_SETUPTOOLS_INSTALL_FROM_RESOLVE'
  toml_repr={`[setuptools]
install_from_resolve = <str>`}
  default_repr={`None`}
>

If specified, install the tool using the lockfile for this named resolve.

This resolve must be defined in `[python].resolves`, as described in https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.25/docs/python/overview/lockfiles#lockfiles-for-tools.

The resolve&#x27;s entire lockfile will be installed, unless specific requirements are listed via the `requirements` option, in which case only those requirements will be installed. This is useful if you don&#x27;t want to invalidate the tool&#x27;s outputs when the resolve incurs changes to unrelated requirements.

If unspecified, and the `lockfile` option is unset, the tool will be installed using the default lockfile shipped with Pants, which uses `setuptools` version 74.1.2.

If unspecified, and the `lockfile` option is set, the tool will use the custom `setuptools` &#x22;tool lockfile&#x22; generated from the `version` and `extra_requirements` options. But note that this mechanism is deprecated.

</Option>

### `requirements`

<Option
  cli_repr={`--setuptools-requirements="['<str>', '<str>', ...]"`}
  env_repr='PANTS_SETUPTOOLS_REQUIREMENTS'
  toml_repr={`[setuptools]
requirements = [
    '<str>',
    '<str>',
    ...,
]`}
  default_repr={`[]`}
>

If `install_from_resolve` is specified, install these requirements, at the versions provided by the specified resolve&#x27;s lockfile.

Values can be pip-style requirements (e.g., `tool` or `tool==1.2.3` or `tool>=1.2.3`), or addresses of `python_requirement` targets (or targets that generate or depend on `python_requirement` targets). Make sure to use the `//` prefix to refer to targets using their full address from the root (e.g. `//3rdparty/python:tool`). This is necessary to distinguish address specs from local or VCS requirements.

The lockfile will be validated against the requirements - if a lockfile doesn&#x27;t provide the requirement (at a suitable version, if the requirement specifies version constraints) Pants will error.

If unspecified, install the entire lockfile.
