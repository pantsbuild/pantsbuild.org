## What is Pants?

Pants is a scalable build system for _monorepos_: codebases containing multiple projects—often using multiple programming languages and frameworks—in a single unified code repository.

Monorepos have many advantages, but they require appropriate tooling in order to scale. Pants provides this tooling.

## What are the main features of Pants?

Pants is designed for fast, consistent builds. Some noteworthy features include:

- Dependency modeling with minimal boilerplate.
- Fine-grained invalidation.
- Shared result caching.
- Concurrent execution.
- Remote execution.
- Unified interface for multiple tools and languages.
- Extensibility and customizability via a plugin API.

## Which languages and frameworks does Pants support?

Pants currently works with Python code, but support for other languages, including Javascript/Node, Java, Scala and more, is coming soon.

## How does Pants work?

See [here](./how-does-pants-work.mdx) for details about the Pants engine.

## Who develops Pants?

Pants is an open-source software project, developed at [github.com/pantsbuild/pants](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants). Pants is released under the [Apache License 2.0](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/blob/master/LICENSE).

:::note Pants 1.x vs. 2.x
This documentation is for Pants 2.0, which is a ground-up redesign of Pants based on lessons from the past 10 years of development. See [here](https://v1.pantsbuild.org/) for Pants v1 documentation, which includes support for Node, Go, Java, and Scala.
