We are pleased to announce Pants [2.24.0](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/blob/2.24.x/docs/notes/2.24.x.md), the latest release of [Pantsbuild, the scalable and ergonomic build system](https://www.pantsbuild.org/). To update, set `pants_version = "2.24.0"` in your `pants.toml`. If you're not using Pants yet, [get started now](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.24/docs/getting-started).

_Highlights in [2.24](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/blob/2.24.x/docs/notes/2.24.x.md) include_:

- üì¶ Out of the box support for Python 3.13.
- ü™õ `pants export --bin` allows exporting more tools for use outside Pants
- üêç A new experimental Python Provider backend using [Python Build Standalone](https://gregoryszorc.com/docs/python-build-standalone/main/).
- üîú A new option system that unlocks future changes.
- üêû And a whole bunch of updates, bugfixes, and general improvements.

And some heads up of coming changes:

- Pants 2.24x will suggest you upgrade to the at least version `0.12.2` of the `pants` [launcher binary](https://github.com/pantsbuild/scie-pants/) [following the upgrade instructions](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.24/docs/getting-started/installing-pants#upgrading-pants). This supports underlying improvements coming in Pants 2.25.
- As in the previous release, in `2.24.x` we continue to run both the new and the legacy options systems concurrently and compare the results, issuing warnings if there are any discrepancies. If you do encounter discrepancies that you can't resolve on your own, please [reach out to us!](https://www.pantsbuild.org/community/getting-help).
