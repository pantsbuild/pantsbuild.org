Hello friends! Every year around this time, we do a survey of the community, to identify community members' wishlist for the year ahead, and get a sense of what's highest priority. Your responses help the Pantsbuild team figure out how to make the most impact on your productivity. The survey has two rounds: in round 1, we gather your freeform ideas and then either connect them to an existing issue or open new issues. In round 2, we ask you to help rank the issues.

Thank you for your responses to round 1 of the survey! We have gone through all of the responses, and now it's time for round 2. This survey asks you how important certain features would be to your continued or increased use of Pants. [Take the survey now!](https://forms.gle/BK6muo7oWQFSiAmh6) Please respond to the survey only once, but feel free to send it to any Pants-using friends you may have. Thanks again, we're excited to hear what you're interested in!
