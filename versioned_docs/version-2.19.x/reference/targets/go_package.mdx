import Field from "@site/src/components/reference/Field";
import styles from "@site/src/components/reference/styles.module.css";

---

A first-party Go package (corresponding to a directory with `.go` files).

Expects that there is a `go_mod` target in its directory or in an ancestor directory.

Backend: <span className="color--primary">`pants.backend.experimental.go`</span>

## `tags`

<Field
    type_repr={`field.type_hint`}
>

Arbitrary strings to describe a target.

For example, you may tag some test targets with &#x27;integration_test&#x27; so that you could run `scie-pants-linux-x86_64 --tag='integration_test' test ::` to only run on targets with that tag.

</Field>

## `description`

<Field
    type_repr={`field.type_hint`}
>

A human-readable description of the target.

Use `scie-pants-linux-x86_64 list --documented ::` to see all targets with descriptions.

</Field>

## `dependencies`

<Field
    type_repr={`field.type_hint`}
>

Addresses to other targets that this target depends on, e.g. `['helloworld/subdir:lib', 'helloworld/main.py:lib', '3rdparty:reqs#django']`.

This augments any dependencies inferred by Pants, such as by analyzing your imports. Use `scie-pants-linux-x86_64 dependencies` or `scie-pants-linux-x86_64 peek` on this target to get the final result.

See https://www.pantsbuild.org/v2.19/docs/targets for more about how addresses are formed, including for generated targets. You can also run `scie-pants-linux-x86_64 list ::` to find all addresses in your project, or `scie-pants-linux-x86_64 list dir` to find all addresses defined in that directory.

If the target is in the same BUILD file, you can leave off the BUILD file path, e.g. `:tgt` instead of `helloworld/subdir:tgt`. For generated first-party addresses, use `./` for the file path, e.g. `./main.py:tgt`; for all other generated targets, use `:tgt#generated_name`.

You may exclude dependencies by prefixing with `!`, e.g. `['!helloworld/subdir:lib', '!./sibling.txt']`. Ignores are intended for false positives with dependency inference; otherwise, simply leave off the dependency from the BUILD file.

</Field>

## `sources`

<Field
    type_repr={`field.type_hint`}
    default_repr={`('*.go',)`}
>

A list of files and globs that belong to this target.

Paths are relative to the BUILD file&#x27;s directory. You can ignore files/globs by prefixing them with `!`.

Example: `sources=['example.go', '*_test.go', '!test_ignore.go']`

</Field>

## `test_extra_env_vars`

<Field
    type_repr={`field.type_hint`}
>

Additional environment variables to include in test processes.

Entries are strings in the form `ENV_VAR=value` to use explicitly; or just `ENV_VAR` to copy the value of a variable in Pants&#x27;s own environment.

This will be merged with and override values from `[test].extra_env_vars`.

</Field>

## `test_timeout`

<Field
    type_repr={`field.type_hint`}
>

A timeout (in seconds) used by each test file belonging to this target.

If unset, will default to `[test].timeout_default`; if that option is also unset, then the test will never time out. Will never exceed `[test].timeout_maximum`. Only applies if the option `--test-timeouts` is set to true (the default).

</Field>

## `test_race`

<Field
    type_repr={`field.type_hint`}
>

Enable compiling this package&#x27;s test binary with the Go data race detector.

See https://go.dev/doc/articles/race_detector for additional information about the Go data race detector.

</Field>

## `test_msan`

<Field
    type_repr={`field.type_hint`}
>

Enable interoperation between Go code and the C/C++ &quot;memory sanitizer&quot; when building this package&#x27;s test binary.

See https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/MemorySanitizer for additional information about the C/C++ memory sanitizer.

</Field>

## `test_asan`

<Field
    type_repr={`field.type_hint`}
>

Enable interoperation between Go code and the C/C++ &quot;address sanitizer&quot; when building this package&#x27;s test binary.

See https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/AddressSanitizer for additional information about the C/C++ address sanitizer.

</Field>

## `assembler_flags`

<Field
    type_repr={`field.type_hint`}
>

Extra flags to pass to the Go assembler (i.e., `go tool asm`) when assembling Go-format assembly code.

Note: These flags will not be added to gcc/clang-format assembly that is assembled in packages using Cgo.

This field can be specified on several different target types:

- On `go_mod` targets, the assembler flags are used when building any package involving the module including both first-party (i.e., `go_package` targets) and third-party dependencies.

- On `go_binary` targets, the assembler flags are used when building any packages comprising that binary including third-party dependencies. These assembler flags will be added after any assembler flags added by any `assembler_flags` field set on the applicable `go_mod` target.

- On `go_package` targets, the assembler flags are used only for building that specific package and not for any other package. These assembler flags will be added after any assembler flags added by any `assembler_flags` field set on the applicable `go_mod` target or applicable `go_binary` target.

Run `go doc cmd/asm` to see the flags supported by `go tool asm`.

</Field>

## `compiler_flags`

<Field
    type_repr={`field.type_hint`}
>

Extra flags to pass to the Go compiler (i.e., `go tool compile`) when compiling Go code.

This field can be specified on several different target types:

- On `go_mod` targets, the compiler flags are used when compiling any package involving the module including both first-party (i.e., `go_package` targets) and third-party dependencies.

- On `go_binary` targets, the compiler flags are used when compiling any packages comprising that binary including third-party dependencies. These compiler flags will be added after any compiler flags added by any `compiler_flags` field set on the applicable `go_mod` target.

- On `go_package` targets, the compiler flags are used only for compiling that specific package and not for any other package. These compiler flags will be added after any compiler flags added by any `compiler_flags` field set on the applicable `go_mod` target or applicable `go_binary` target.

Run `go doc cmd/compile` to see the flags supported by `go tool compile`.

</Field>

## `skip_tests`

<Field
    type_repr={`field.type_hint`}
    default_repr={`False`}
>

If true, don&#x27;t run this package&#x27;s tests.

</Field>

## `skip_gofmt`

<Field
    type_repr={`field.type_hint`}
    default_repr={`False`}
    backend="pants.backend.experimental.go"
>

If true, don&#x27;t run gofmt on this package.

</Field>
