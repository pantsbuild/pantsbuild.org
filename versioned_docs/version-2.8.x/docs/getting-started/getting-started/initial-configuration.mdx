Creating the initial pants.toml config file.

---

Pants has a robust options system, allowing you to configure hundreds of options. Every Pants option can be set via a command-line flag, an environment variable, or, most commonly, a config file.

The options system is described in detail [here](../../using-pants/key-concepts-to-know-about-pants/options.mdx). This page will set up your initial Pants config file.

## 1. Create `pants.toml`

Pants configuration lives in a file called `pants.toml` in the root of the repo. This file uses the [TOML](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml) format.

If you haven't yet, create a `pants.toml` file:

```toml title="pants.toml"
[GLOBAL]
pants_version = "$PANTS_VERSION"
```

where `$PANTS_VERSION` is the version of Pants you want to pin your repo to. When you'd like to upgrade Pants, edit `pants_version` and the `./pants` script will self-update on the next run.

## 2. Configure source roots

Some project layouts use top-level folders for namespace purposes, but have the code live underneath. However, the code's imports will ignore these top-level folders, thanks to mechanisms like the `$PYTHONPATH` and the JVM classpath. For example, to import the file `src/my_project/app.py`, many projects use `import my_project.app`, rather than `import src.my_project.app`. _Source roots_ are how Pants understands these imports.

By default, Pants recognizes having no source root, or having `src`, `src/python`, or `src/py` as source roots. If your project has a different structure, see [Source roots](../../using-pants/key-concepts-to-know-about-pants/source-roots.mdx) for how to configure them, and for examples of different project structures with Pants.

:::note Golang projects can skip this step
Golang projects already use `go.mod` as an equivalent to "source roots".

## 3. Enable backends

Most Pants functionality is provided via pluggable [_backends_](../../using-pants/key-concepts-to-know-about-pants/backends.mdx), which are activated by adding to the `[GLOBAL].backend_packages` option like this:

```toml title="pants.toml"
[GLOBAL]
...
backend_packages = [
  "pants.backend.go",
  "pants.backend.python",
  "pants.backend.python.lint.black",
]
```

## 4. Generate BUILD files

Finally, once you have enabled the backends for the language(s) you'd like to use, run [`./pants tailor`](./create-initial-build-files.mdx) to generate BUILD files for Pants to know which code to operate on.
