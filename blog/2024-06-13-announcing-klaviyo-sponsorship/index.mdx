# Announcing Klaviyo's Sponsorship

Today we are excited to announce that [Klaviyo](https://www.klaviyo.com/) has become the first Platinum sponsor of the Pants project via the [corporate sponsorship program](https://www.pantsbuild.org/sponsorship#corporate-sponsorship)! This is one of the first such sponsorships through our new [Open Source Sponsorship program](https://klaviyo.tech/inaugurating-our-open-source-sponsorship-program-df0572cc9c18), through which we are trying to support the open source projects we depend on. While the core development and maintenance of Pants is volunteer driven, there are costs involved with maintaining and distributing such a large piece of software, costs which far too often are covered by individual volunteers. We benefit enormously from this project and want to help contribute to its ongoing success.

Klaviyo chose Pants as the build system for our backend monorepo 18 months ago (read about how we chose Pants [here](https://klaviyo.tech/why-we-chose-pants-906891a98a6e)). Since then, we have been impressed not only by the power, flexibility and ease of use relative to other systems that Pants offers, but also by the amazing community that surrounds it. It is truly the Pants community that sets it apart, from active development efforts to the vibrant and welcoming Slack. This community is a prime reason we chose Pants, and is what we hope to foster with our sponsorship.

Like all software of this size, we recognize there are costs associated with the development of Pants - from compute costs for CI, to hosting for the incredible documentation site. We are happy to help fund these costs so that the project and community can continue to grow. We hope that our initial sponsorship will prompt other commercial businesses using Pants to do the same, at any level of support, helping to support a growing Pants community for years to come.
