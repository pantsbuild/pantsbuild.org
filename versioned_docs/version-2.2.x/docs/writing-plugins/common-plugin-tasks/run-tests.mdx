How to add a new test runner to the `test` goal.

---

:::note Example repository
This guide walks through adding a simple `test` implementation for Bash that runs the `shunit2` test runner. See [here](https://github.com/pantsbuild/example-plugin/blob/main/pants-plugins/examples/bash/shunit2_test_runner.py) for the final implementation.
:::

## 1. Set up a tests target type

Usually, you will want to add a "tests" target type for your language, such as `bash_tests` or `python_tests`. A binary target contrasts with a "library" target, such as `bash_library`. A test target is useful so that `./pants test ::` doesn't try to run tests on non-test files.

When creating a tests target, you should usually subclass the `Sources` field and set the `default`. You may also want to create a `Timeout` field, which should subclass `IntField`.

See [Creating new targets](../the-target-api/creating-new-targets.mdx) for a guide on how to define new target types.

```python
from pants.engine.target import COMMON_TARGET_FIELDS, Dependencies, IntField, Sources, Target

class BashSources(Sources):
    expected_file_extensions = (".sh",)


class BashTestSources(BashSources):
    default = ("*_test.sh", "test_*.sh")


class BashTestTimeout(IntField):
     """Whether to time out after a certain amount of time.

      If unset, the test will never time out.
      """

     alias = "timeout"


class BashTests(Target):
    """Bash tests that are run via `shunit2`."""

    alias = "bash_tests"
    core_fields = (*COMMON_TARGET_FIELDS, Dependencies, BashTestSources, BashTestTimeout)

```

## 2. Set up a subclass of `TestFieldSet`
