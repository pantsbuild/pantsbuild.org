We are pleased to announce Pants [2.25.0](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/blob/2.25.x/docs/notes/2.25.x.md), the latest release of [Pantsbuild, the scalable and ergonomic build system](https://www.pantsbuild.org/). To update, set `pants_version = "2.25.0"` in your `pants.toml`. If you're not using Pants yet, [get started now](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.25/docs/getting-started).

Thank you to [Klaviyo](https://www.klaviyo.com/) and [Normal Computing](https://normalcomputing.ai/) for their Platinum tier support throughout this release!

Pants 2.25 requires version `0.12.2` or newer of the `pants` [launcher binary](https://github.com/pantsbuild/scie-pants/). [Follow the upgrade instructions](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.25/docs/getting-started/installing-pants#upgrading-pants) to ensure you are using a compatible version of the launcher binary.

_Highlights in [2.25](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/blob/2.25.x/docs/notes/2.25.x.md) include_:

- üêç Pants itself now runs using Python 3.11 (previously 3.9), meaning plugins can use newer language features. Pants still works with user code using other Python versions.
- üêã A Rust-based new parser for Dockerfiles (for dependency inference) is being rolled out to replace the old one. This parser is faster and doesn't require installing extra dependencies.
- ‚òï Improved dependency inference for the JavaScript (and TypeScript) backends.
- üì¨ A new OpenAPI backend for Python.
- üêû And a whole bunch of updates, bugfixes, and general improvements.
