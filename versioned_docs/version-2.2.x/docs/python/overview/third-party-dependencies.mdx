How to use third-party Python libraries in your project.

---

## Basic setup

To set up third-party dependencies in your project, use a regular [`requirements.txt`](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/#requirements-files) file.

Then, in the same directory, create a `BUILD` file that invokes the `python_requirements()` macro:

```text tab={"label":"requirements.txt"}
flask>=1.1.2,<1.3
requests[security]==2.23.0
dataclasses ; python_version<'3.7'
```

```python tab={"label":"BUILD"}
python_requirements()
```

Pants will use the `python_requirements()` macro to create a distinct `python_requirement_library` target for each specified requirement.

Pants will then use [dependency inference](../../using-pants/concepts/targets-and-build-files.mdx) by looking at your Python import statements to automatically add those targets to the `dependencies` field. For example:

```shell tab={"label":"shell"}
$ ./pants dependencies project/app.py
//:flask
//:requests
```

```python tab={"label":"project/app.py"}
import flask
import requests

...
```

If any of your dependencies expose modules with names different than the project name (i.e. having a requirement named `ansicolors` that is imported as `colors`), you can teach Pants about it by setting `module_mapping`:

```python title="BUILD"
python_requirements(
    module_mapping={
        "ansicolors": ["colors"],
        "setuptools": ["pkg_resources"]
    },
)
```

You can also add an explicit dependency by adding the `python_requirement_library` target to the `dependencies` field for a target. This will make sure that the dependency is included regardless of if dependency inference can infer it or not. For example:

```python title="project/BUILD"
python_library(
    dependencies=[
        # We don't have an import statement for this dep, so inference
        # won't add it automatically. We add it explicitly instead.
        "//:psyscopg2-binary",
    ],
)
```

:::note Where should I put the requirements.txt?
You can put the file wherever makes the most sense for your project.

In smaller repositories that only use Python, it's often convenient to put the file at the "build root" (top-level), as used on this page.

For larger repositories or multilingual repositories, it's often useful to have a `3rdparty` or `3rdparty/python` directory. Rather than the target's address being `//:my_requirement`, its address would be `3rdparty/python:my_requirement`, for example.
:::

:::note Requirements files with custom names
Your requirements file doesn't have to be named `requirements.txt`. You can point the `python_requirements` macro at any other name:

```
python_requirements(
    requirements_relpath="custom-requirements.txt",
)
```

:::

:::caution Multiple requirements files
Pants can support multiple requirements files (each with a corresponding `python_requirements` macro invocation) in a single repo.

However if those requirements overlap there will be multiple targets for the same package, and Pants will not be able to infer which of them a dependency should be on.

If the version constraints for the overlapping requirements do not conflict, you may wish to refactor the common requirements out of your requirements files and include them with `-r common-requirements.txt`. Then dependency inference will see a single target for each of those common requirements.

If the version constraints do conflict, or if you otherwise cannot refactor them out, then you will have to specify the relevant dependencies manually.

We plan to support multiple requirements "universes" more robustly in the future, but it will always be preferable to have a single consistently resolvable universe of requirements for your repo, if possible. Pants selects requirement subsets as needed, so adding requirements to a global requirements.txt does not add unnecessary dependencies or bloat.
:::

:::note Installing from version control or local files
You might be used to using pip's proprietary VCS-style requirements for this, like `git+https://github.com/django/django.git#egg=django`. However, this proprietary format does not work with Pants.

Instead of pip VCS-style requirements:

```
git+https://github.com/django/django.git#egg=Django
git+https://github.com/django/django.git@stable/2.1.x#egg=Django
git+https://github.com/django/django.git@fd209f62f1d83233cc634443cfac5ee4328d98b8#egg=Django
```

Use direct references from [PEP 440](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/#direct-references):

```
Django@ git+https://github.com/django/django.git
Django@ git+https://github.com/django/django.git@stable/2.1.x
Django@ git+https://github.com/django/django.git@fd209f62f1d83233cc634443cfac5ee4328d98b8
```

You can also install from local files using [PEP 440 direct references](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/#direct-references). You must use an absolute path to the file, and you should ensure that the file exists on your machine.

```
Django @ file:///Users/pantsbuild/prebuilt_wheels/django-3.1.1-py3-none-any.whl
```

Pip still works with these PEP 440-compliant formats, so you won't be losing any functionality by switching to using them.
:::

## Using a lockfile (strongly recommended)

Lockfiles are important for reproducible builds. They ensure that the selected versions of all transitive dependencies are consistent, even when third-party libraries release new versions.

If you define a lockfile, Pants will also optimize to avoid resolving requirements more than one time for your project. This greatly speeds up the performance of goals like `test`, `run`, and `repl`. (See [python-setup](../../../reference/subsystems/python-setup.mdx) for more information on the `resolve_all_constraints` option.)

Pants uses Pip's [constraints file](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/#constraints-files) feature to support lockfiles. Constraints files tell Pip to use the specified version of a library when encountered, even if it overrides what was specified in your `requirements.txt`.

:::caution Constraints files are not strongly validated
It is possible to put conflicting versions in a constraints file, and to leave off constraints for some of your dependencies; Pip doesn't check for this. Unfortunately, the onus is on you to make sure that your constraints file is sound.
:::

To use this feature, create a `constraints.txt` file that pins versions of all your transitive third-party dependencies.

Then tell Pants about the file with the `requirement_constraints` option in the `[python-setup]` scope, like this:

```toml tab={"label":"pants.toml"}
[python-setup]
requirement_constraints = "constraints.txt"
```

```text tab={"label":"constraints.txt"}
certifi==2019.6.16
chardet==3.0.2
idna==2.7
requests==2.23.0
urllib3==1.25.6
```

Pants will then pass this constraints file to Pip whenever resolving third party dependencies.

:::note How do I generate a lockfile?
The simplest approach is to create a virtual environment for your project and then to use this to generate a `constraints.txt` file. See below for an example script.

You may alternatively use a tool like [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org) or [Pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/), then use their `export` commands to generate a `constraints.txt` file.
:::

:::caution Need support for multiple lockfiles?
For now, Pants only supports one single global lockfile. But, we are considering adding support for multiple lockfiles. Please message us on [Slack](/community/members) if you would like this feature - we would appreciate feedback on your use case.

## Defining inline requirements

Sometimes you may want to use a certain dependency without adding it to your `requirements.txt`. For example, you may want to use a different version than what is in `requirements.txt`. Or, you may want to only use the requirement in one location and don't want it to discoverable by all targets.

Pants allows you to define inline requirements with the target type `python_requirement_library`, like this:

```python title="project/BUILD"
python_requirement_library(
    name="old_requests",
    requirements=["requests==2.8.0"],
)

pex_binary(
    name="app",
    sources=["app.py"],
    dependencies=[
        ":old_requests",
    ],
)
```

If any of your dependencies expose modules with names different than the project name, you can teach Pants about it by setting `module_mapping`:

```python title="project/BUILD"
python_requirement_library(
    name="old_requests",
    requirements=["ansicolors=1.18.0"],
    module_mapping={"ansicolors": ["colors"]},
)
```

## Using custom repositories

If you host your own wheels at a custom index (aka "cheese shop"), you can instruct Pants to use it with the option `indexes` in the `[python-repos]` scope.

```toml title="pants.toml"
[python-repos]
indexes.add = ["https://custom-cheeseshop.net/simple"]
```

To exclusively use your custom index—i.e. to not use PyPI—use `indexes = [..]` instead of `indexes.add = [..]`.

## Tip: Set up a virtual environment (optional)

While Pants itself doesn't need a [virtualenv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html), it may be useful to create one for working with your tooling outside Pants, such as your IDE.

You can create a virtualenv using standard Python tooling—such as [Python's builtin `venv` module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)—along with running Pants to query for all of your Python requirements.

For example, this script will first create a venv, and then generate a `constraints.txt` file.

```shell title="build-support/generate_constraints.sh"
#!/usr/bin/env bash

set -euo pipefail

# You can change these constants.
PYTHON_BIN=python3
VIRTUALENV=build-support/.venv
PIP="${VIRTUALENV}/bin/pip"
REQUIREMENTS_FILE=requirements.txt
CONSTRAINTS_FILE=constraints.txt

"${PYTHON_BIN}" -m venv "${VIRTUALENV}"
"${PIP}" install pip --upgrade
# Install all our requirements.txt, and also any 3rdparty
# dependencies specified outside requirements.txt, e.g. via a
# handwritten python_requirement_library target.
"${PIP}" install \
  -r "${REQUIREMENTS_FILE}" \
  -r <(./pants dependencies --type=3rdparty ::)
echo "# Generated by build-support/generate_constraints.sh on $(date)" > "${CONSTRAINTS_FILE}"
"${PIP}" freeze --all >> "${CONSTRAINTS_FILE}"
```

:::caution This script only captures handwritten dependencies that are consumed
This script will capture all requirements in your `requirements.txt`, whether they are actually consumed by your code or not.

However, due to how the `./pants dependencies` goal works, it will only capture 3rdparty dependencies specified outside `requirements.txt` (i.e., via a handwritten `python_requirement_library target`) if those are actually used by your code.
