Python tests.

These may be written in either Pytest-style or unittest style.

All test util code, other than `conftest.py`, should go into a dedicated `python_library()`
target and then be included in the `dependencies` field.

See https://www.pantsbuild.org/docs/python-test-goal.

## `tags`

<Field
    type_repr={`field.type_hint`}
>

Arbitrary strings that you can use to describe a target. For example, you may tag some test targets with &#x27;integration_test&#x27; so that you could run `./pants --tags='integration_test' test ::` to only run on targets with that tag.

</Field>

## `description`

<Field
    type_repr={`field.type_hint`}
>

A human-readable description of the target. Use `./pants list --documented ::` to see all targets with descriptions.

</Field>

## `compatibility`

<Field
    type_repr={`field.type_hint`}
>

A string for Python interpreter constraints on this target. This should be written in Requirement-style format, e.g. `CPython==2.7.*` or `CPython>=3.6,<4`. As a shortcut, you can leave off `CPython`, e.g. `>=2.7` will be expanded to `CPython>=2.7`. If this is left off, this will default to the option `interpreter_constraints` in the [python-setup] scope. See https://www.pantsbuild.org/docs/python-interpreter-compatibility.

</Field>

## `sources`

<Field
    type_repr={`field.type_hint`}
    default_repr={`('test_*.py', '*_test.py', 'tests.py', 'conftest.py', 'test_*.pyi', '*_test.pyi', 'tests.pyi')`}
>

A list of files and globs that belong to this target. Paths are relative to the BUILD file&#x27;s directory. You can ignore files/globs by prefixing them with `!`. Example: `sources=['example.py', 'test_*.py', '!test_ignore.py']`.

</Field>

## `dependencies`

<Field
    type_repr={`field.type_hint`}
>

Addresses to other targets that this target depends on, e.g. [&#x27;helloworld/subdir:lib&#x27;]. Alternatively, you may include file names. Pants will find which target owns that file, and create a new target from that which only includes the file in its `sources` field. For files relative to the current BUILD file, prefix with `./`; otherwise, put the full path, e.g. [&#x27;./sibling.txt&#x27;, &#x27;resources/demo.json&#x27;]. You may exclude dependencies by prefixing with `!`, e.g. `['!helloworld/subdir:lib', '!./sibling.txt']`. Ignores are intended for false positives with dependency inference; otherwise, simply leave off the dependency from the BUILD file.

</Field>

## `runtime_package_dependencies`

<Field
    type_repr={`field.type_hint`}
>

Addresses to targets that can be built with the `./pants package` goal and whose resulting assets should be included in the test run. Pants will build the assets as if you had run `./pants package`. It will include the results in your archive using the same name they would normally have, but without the `--distdir` prefix (e.g. `dist/`). You can include anything that can be built by `./pants package`, e.g. a `pex_binary`, `python_awslambda`, or an `archive`.

</Field>

## `timeout`

<Field
    type_repr={`field.type_hint`}
>

A timeout (in seconds) which covers the total runtime of all tests in this target. This only applies if the option `--pytest-timeouts` is set to True.

</Field>
