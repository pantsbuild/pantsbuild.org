Upgrade syntax for newer versions of the language (https://github.com/asottile/pyupgrade).

This version of Pants uses `pyupgrade` version 3.21.0 by default. Use a dedicated lockfile and the `install_from_resolve` option to control this.

## Basic options

### `args`

<Option
  cli_repr={`--pyupgrade-args="[<shell_str>, <shell_str>, ...]"`}
  env_repr='PANTS_PYUPGRADE_ARGS'
  toml_repr={`[pyupgrade]
args = [
    <shell_str>,
    <shell_str>,
    ...,
]`}
  default_repr={`[]`}
>

Arguments to pass directly to pyupgrade, e.g. `--pyupgrade-args='--py39-plus --keep-runtime-typing'`.

</Option>

### `skip`

<Option
  cli_repr={`--[no-]pyupgrade-skip`}
  env_repr='PANTS_PYUPGRADE_SKIP'
  toml_repr={`[pyupgrade]
skip = <bool>`}
  default_repr={`False`}
>

If true, don&#x27;t use pyupgrade when running `pants fmt` and `pants lint`.

</Option>

## Advanced options

### `console_script`

<Option
  cli_repr={`--pyupgrade-console-script=<str>`}
  env_repr='PANTS_PYUPGRADE_CONSOLE_SCRIPT'
  toml_repr={`[pyupgrade]
console_script = <str>`}
  default_repr={`pyupgrade`}
>

The console script for the tool. Using this option is generally preferable to (and mutually exclusive with) specifying an `--entry-point` since console script names have a higher expectation of staying stable across releases of the tool. Usually, you will not want to change this from the default.

</Option>

### `entry_point`

<Option
  cli_repr={`--pyupgrade-entry-point=<str>`}
  env_repr='PANTS_PYUPGRADE_ENTRY_POINT'
  toml_repr={`[pyupgrade]
entry_point = <str>`}
  default_repr={`None`}
>

The entry point for the tool. Generally you only want to use this option if the tool does not offer a `--console-script` (which this option is mutually exclusive with). Usually, you will not want to change this from the default.

</Option>

### `install_from_resolve`

<Option
  cli_repr={`--pyupgrade-install-from-resolve=<str>`}
  env_repr='PANTS_PYUPGRADE_INSTALL_FROM_RESOLVE'
  toml_repr={`[pyupgrade]
install_from_resolve = <str>`}
  default_repr={`None`}
>

If specified, install the tool using the lockfile for this named resolve.

This resolve must be defined in `[python].resolves`, as described in https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.32/docs/python/overview/lockfiles#lockfiles-for-tools.

The resolve&#x27;s entire lockfile will be installed, unless specific requirements are listed via the `requirements` option, in which case only those requirements will be installed. This is useful if you don&#x27;t want to invalidate the tool&#x27;s outputs when the resolve incurs changes to unrelated requirements.

If unspecified, and the `lockfile` option is unset, the tool will be installed using the default lockfile shipped with Pants, which uses `pyupgrade` version 3.21.0.

If unspecified, and the `lockfile` option is set, the tool will use the custom `pyupgrade` &#x22;tool lockfile&#x22; generated from the `version` and `extra_requirements` options. But note that this mechanism is deprecated.

</Option>

### `interpreter_constraints`

<Option
  cli_repr={`--pyupgrade-interpreter-constraints="['<str>', '<str>', ...]"`}
  env_repr='PANTS_PYUPGRADE_INTERPRETER_CONSTRAINTS'
  toml_repr={`[pyupgrade]
interpreter_constraints = [
    '<str>',
    '<str>',
    ...,
]`}
  default_repr={`[\n  "CPython>=3.9,<3.15"\n]`}
>

Python interpreter constraints for this tool.

</Option>

### `requirements`

<Option
  cli_repr={`--pyupgrade-requirements="['<str>', '<str>', ...]"`}
  env_repr='PANTS_PYUPGRADE_REQUIREMENTS'
  toml_repr={`[pyupgrade]
requirements = [
    '<str>',
    '<str>',
    ...,
]`}
  default_repr={`[]`}
>

If `install_from_resolve` is specified, install these requirements, at the versions provided by the specified resolve&#x27;s lockfile.

Values can be pip-style requirements (e.g., `tool` or `tool==1.2.3` or `tool>=1.2.3`), or addresses of `python_requirement` targets (or targets that generate or depend on `python_requirement` targets). Make sure to use the `//` prefix to refer to targets using their full address from the root (e.g. `//3rdparty/python:tool`). This is necessary to distinguish address specs from local or VCS requirements.

The lockfile will be validated against the requirements - if a lockfile doesn&#x27;t provide the requirement (at a suitable version, if the requirement specifies version constraints) Pants will error.

If unspecified, install the entire lockfile.
