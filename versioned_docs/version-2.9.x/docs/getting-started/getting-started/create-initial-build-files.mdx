    title: Create initial BUILD files
    position: 4

Many Pants operations require extra metadata in the form of [_targets_](../../using-pants/key-concepts/targets-and-build-files.mdx), which are defined in `BUILD` files.

You can generate these BUILD files by running `./pants tailor`:

```
❯ ./pants tailor
Created scripts/BUILD:
  - Add shell_sources target scripts
Created src/py/project/BUILD:
  - Add python_sources target project
  - Add python_tests target tests
Created src/go/BUILD:
  - Add go_mod target mod
```

Often, this will be all you need for Pants to work, thanks to sensible defaults and inference, like [inferring your dependencies](../../using-pants/key-concepts/targets-and-build-files.mdx). Sometimes, though, you may need to or want to change certain fields, like setting a longer timeout on a test.

You may also need to add some targets that Pants cannot generate, like [`resources` and `files`](../../using-pants/assets-and-archives.mdx) targets.

We recommend running `./pants tailor --check` in your [continuous integration](../../using-pants/using-pants-in-ci.mdx) so that you don't forget to add any targets and BUILD files.

```
❯ ./pants tailor --check
Would create scripts/BUILD:
  - Add shell_sources target scripts

To fix `tailor` failures, run `./pants tailor`.
```

To ignore false positives, set `[tailor].ignore_paths` and `[tailor].ignore_adding_targets`. See [tailor](../../../reference/goals/tailor.mdx) for more detail.

```toml title="pants.toml"
[tailor]
ignore_paths = ["src/py/ignore_me/**"]
ignore_adding_targets = ["src/py/project:tgt"]
```

## Formatting BUILD files with Black

`./pants run update-build-files` will format your BUILD files with the Black Python formatter. The goal will also fix any safe Pants deprecations like renaming target types.

```
❯ ./pants update-build-files
Updated scripts/BUILD:
  - Format with Black
  - Rename `python_library` to `python_sources`
```

Like `tailor`, we recommend running `./pants update-build-files --check` in your [continuous integration](../../using-pants/using-pants-in-ci.mdx).

```
❯ ./pants update-build-files --check
Would update scripts/BUILD:
  - Format with Black
  - Rename `python_library` to `python_sources`

To fix `update-build-files` failures, run `./pants update-build-files`.
```
