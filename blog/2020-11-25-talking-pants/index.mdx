Pants contributors [Eric Arellano](https://github.com/Eric-Arellano) and [Stu Hood](https://github.com/stuhood) sat down recently with Tobias Macey, host of the popular `Podcast.__init__`, to talk about Python monorepos and how Pants supports them.

Listen in to learn about the history of Pants (including the origin of the name!), the advantages of a single unified codebase, how Pants supports effective workflows in a growing repo, and the joys of using Turtle graphics to teach programming to kids...

Our thanks to Tobias for giving us an opportunity to introduce Pants to the podcast audience. If you enjoyed this episode, I recommend checking out the many other fascinating ones. I've been looking for some new podcasts to listen to while running, and `Podcast.__init__` is in the rotation now!
