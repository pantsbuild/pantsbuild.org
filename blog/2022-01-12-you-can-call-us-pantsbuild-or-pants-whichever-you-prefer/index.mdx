# You can call us Pantsbuild (or Pants, whichever you prefer)

As more and more people start using and discovering Pants, we've discovered that it's difficult to talk about the tool without introducing it as _The Pants Build System_, which isn't very snappy or easy to remember. Especially in titles of posts or in tweets without that much context, “Pants” on its own doesn't make a lot of sense to many people, and if you don't explicitly append “build”, it's also really difficult to search for “Pants”.

Over the years, our online presence has sprung up around the name Pantsbuild. We use Pantsbuild as [our Twitter handle](https://twitter.com/pantsbuild), the [project's username on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/pantsbuild/), our [domain name](https://pantsbuild.org), and our [GitHub organization name](https://github.com/pantsbuild), to point out just a few. There's more than a few articles from people in the community (but not affiliated with the project) that talk about “using Pantsbuild”.

After some discussion amongst maintainers and [on the Pants Build community Slack](https://pantsbuild.slack.com/archives/C046T6T9U/p1638817238494000), we've decided that _Pantsbuild_ is a perfectly fine thing to call the project too. This doesn't mean that _Pants_ is no longer the name of the project, it's just that Pantsbuild is a name that you can use if you feel like Pants constrains your expression.

So, if you see us talking about Pantsbuild, that's why. Now you can say Pantsbuild too.
