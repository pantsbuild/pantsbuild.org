# 2024 Pantsbuild User Survey

No (software) project survives without listening to its community of users. And the Pants project is no different. What does this mean? It is time for the 2024 Pantsbuild User Survey!

We want to hear from our community about how well (or not so well) the project is going and how it can be improved.

[This Google Form contains a short five question survey.](https://forms.gle/eo7Y4DuxurjaMSZn6)

<!-- truncate -->

It is anonymous, but you may optionally provide us your email in case you are amenable to a potential follow-up to your feedback.

The survey will remain open through the end of the year (although we will be looking at the responses before then). The results will be used to assist the Pants maintainers and contributors to better understand areas where Pants may need work.
