How to adjust for changes made to the Plugin API.

## 2.2

### `PrimitiveField` and `AsyncField` are removed (2.2.0.dev0)

Rather than subclassing `PrimitiveField`, subclass `Field` directly. `Field` now behaves like `PrimitiveField` used to, and `PrimitiveField` was removed for simplicity.

Rather than subclassing `AsyncField` or `AsyncStringSequenceField`, subclass `Field` or a template like `StringField` and also subclass `AsyncFieldMixin`:

```python
from pants.engine.target import AsyncFieldMixin, StringField)

class MyField(StringField, AsyncFieldMixin):
    alias = "my_field"
    help = "Description."
```

Async fields now access the raw value with the property `.value`, rather than `.sanitized_raw_value`. To override the eager validation, override `compute_value()`, rather than `sanitize_raw_value()`. Both these changes bring async fields into alignment with non-async fields.

### Set the property `help` with Subsystems, Targets, and Fields (2.2.0.dev3)

Previously, you were supposed to set the class's docstring for the `./pants help` message. Instead, now set a class property `help`, like this:

```python
class MyField(StringField):
    alias = "my_field"
    help = "A summary.\n\nOptional extra information."
```

Pants will now properly wrap strings and preserve newlines. You may want to run `./pants help ${target/subsystem}` to verify things render properly.

## 2.1

See https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/blob/master/src/python/pants/notes/2.1.x.rst for the changelog.

### `SourcesSnapshot` is now `SpecsSnapshot` (2.1.0rc0)

The type was renamed for clarity. Still import it from `pants.engine.fs`.

## 2.0

See https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/blob/master/src/python/pants/notes/2.0.x.rst for the changelog.

### Use `TransitiveTargetsRequest` as input for resolving `TransitiveTargets` (2.0.0rc0)

Rather than `await Get(TransitiveTargets, Addresses([addr1]))`, use `await Get(TransitiveTargets, TransitiveTargetsRequest([addr1]))`, from `pants.engine.target`.

It's no longer possible to include `TransitiveTargets` in your `@rule` signature in order to get the transitive closure of what the user specified on the command. Instead, put `Addresses` in your rule's signature, and use `await Get(TransitiveTargets, TransitiveTargetsRequest(addresses))`.

### Codegen implementations: use `DependenciesRequestLite` and `TransitiveTargetsLite` (2.0.0rc0)

Due to a new cycle in the rule graph, for any codegen implementations, you must use `DependenciesRequestLite` instead of `DependenciesRequest`, and `TransitiveTargetsLite` instead of `TransitiveTargetsRequest`. Both imports are still from `pants.engine.target`.

These behave identically, except that they do not include dependency inference in the results. Unless you are generating for `input = PythonSources`, this should be fine, as dependency inference is currently only used with Python.

This is tracked by https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/issues/10917.

### Dependencies-like fields have more robust support (2.0.0rc0)

If you have any custom fields that act like the dependencies field, but do not subclass `Dependencies`, there are two new mechanisms for better support.

1. Instead of subclassing `StringSequenceField`, subclass `SpecialCasedDependencies` from `pants.engine.target`. This will ensure that the dependencies show up with `./pants dependencies` and `./pants dependees`.
2. You can use `UnparsedAddressInputs` from `pants.engine.addresses` to resolve the addresses:

```python
from pants.engine.addresses import Address, Addresses, UnparsedAddressedInputs
from pants.engine.target import Targets

...

addresses = await Get(Addresses, UnparsedAddressedInputs(["//:addr1", "project/addr2"], owning_address=None)

# Or, use this.
targets = await Get(
    Targets,
    UnparsedAddressedInputs(["//:addr1", "project/addr2"], owning_address=Address("project", target_name="original")
)
```

If you defined a subclass of `SpecialCasedDependencies`, you can use `await Get(Addresses | Targets, UnparsedAddressInputs, my_tgt[MyField].to_unparsed_address_inputs())`.

(Why would you ever do this? If you have dependencies that you don't treat like normal—e.g. that you will call the equivalent of `./pants package` on those deps—it's often helpful to call out this magic through a dedicated field. For example, Pants's [archive](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/blob/969c8dcba6eda0c939918b3bc5157ca45099b4d1/src/python/pants/core/target_types.py#L231-L257) target type has the fields `files` and `packages`, rather than `dependencies`.)

### `package` implementations may want to add the field `output_path` (2.0.0rc0)

All of Pants's target types that can be built via `./pants package` now have an `output_path` field, which allows the user to override the path used for the created asset.

You optionally may want to add this `output_path` field to your custom target type for consistency:

1. Include `OutputPathField` from `pants.core.goals.package` in your target's `core_fields` class property.
2. In your `PackageFieldSet` subclass, include `output_path: OutputPathField`.
3. When computing the filename in your rule, use `my_package_field_set.output_path.value_or_default(field_set.address, file_ending="my_ext")`.
