title: shunit2_test

import Field from "@site/src/components/reference/Field";
import styles from "@site/src/components/reference/styles.module.css";

---

A single test file for Bourne-based shell scripts using the shunit2 test framework.

To use, add tests to your file per https://github.com/kward/shunit2/. Specify the shell to run with by either setting the field `shell` or including a shebang. To test the same file with multiple shells, create multiple `shunit2_tests` targets, one for each shell.

Pants will automatically download the `shunit2` bash script and add `source ./shunit2` to your test for you. If you already have `source ./shunit2`, Pants will overwrite it to use the correct relative path.

## `tags`

<Field
    type_repr={`field.type_hint`}
>

Arbitrary strings to describe a target.

For example, you may tag some test targets with &#x27;integration_test&#x27; so that you could run `./pants --tag='integration_test' test ::` to only run on targets with that tag.

</Field>

## `description`

<Field
    type_repr={`field.type_hint`}
>

A human-readable description of the target.

Use `./pants list --documented ::` to see all targets with descriptions.

</Field>

## `source`

<Field
    type_repr={`field.type_hint`}
>

A single file that belongs to this target.

Path is relative to the BUILD file&#x27;s directory, e.g. `source='example.ext'`.

</Field>

## `dependencies`

<Field
    type_repr={`field.type_hint`}
>

Addresses to other targets that this target depends on, e.g. [&#x27;helloworld/subdir:lib&#x27;].

Alternatively, you may include file names. Pants will find which target owns that file, and create a new target from that which only includes the file in its `sources` field. For files relative to the current BUILD file, prefix with `./`; otherwise, put the full path, e.g. [&#x27;./sibling.txt&#x27;, &#x27;resources/demo.json&#x27;].

You may exclude dependencies by prefixing with `!`, e.g. `['!helloworld/subdir:lib', '!./sibling.txt']`. Ignores are intended for false positives with dependency inference; otherwise, simply leave off the dependency from the BUILD file.

</Field>

## `timeout`

<Field
    type_repr={`field.type_hint`}
>

A timeout (in seconds) used by each test file belonging to this target. If unset, the test will never time out.

</Field>

## `shell`

<Field
    type_repr={`field.type_hint`}
>

Which shell to run the tests with. If unspecified, Pants will look for a shebang line.

</Field>

## `runtime_package_dependencies`

<Field
    type_repr={`field.type_hint`}
>

Addresses to targets that can be built with the `./pants package` goal and whose resulting artifacts should be included in the test run.

Pants will build the artifacts as if you had run `./pants package`. It will include the results in your test&#x27;s chroot, using the same name they would normally have, but without the `--distdir` prefix (e.g. `dist/`).

You can include anything that can be built by `./pants package`, e.g. a `pex_binary`, `python_awslambda`, or an `archive`.

</Field>

## `skip_shellcheck`

<Field
    type_repr={`field.type_hint`}
    default_repr={`False`}
>

If true, don&#x27;t run Shellcheck on this target&#x27;s code.

</Field>

## `skip_shfmt`

<Field
    type_repr={`field.type_hint`}
    default_repr={`False`}
>

If true, don&#x27;t run shfmt on this target&#x27;s code.

</Field>
