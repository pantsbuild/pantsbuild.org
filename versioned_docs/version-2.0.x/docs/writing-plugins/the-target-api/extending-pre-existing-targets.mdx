Adding new fields to target types.

## When to add new fields?

Adding new fields is useful when you are already using a target type, but need to store additional metadata for your plugin.

For example, if you're writing a codegen plugin to convert a `protobuf_library` into Java source files, you may want to add a `jdk_version` field to `protobuf_library`.

If you are instead adding support for a new language, [create a new target type](./creating-new-targets.mdx).

If you want to reduce boilerplate in BUILD files, such as changing default values, use [macros](../macros.mdx).

## How to add new fields

First, [define the field](./creating-new-fields.mdx). Then, register it by using `OriginalTarget.register_plugin_field(CustomField)`, like this:

```python title="plugins/register.py"
from pants.backend.codegen.protobuf.target_types import ProtobufLibrary
from pants.engine.target import BoolField


class ProtobufJdkVersion(IntField):
    """Which JDK protobuf should target."""

    alias = "jdk_version"
    default = 11


def rules():
    return [ProtobufLibrary.register_plugin_field(ProtobufJdkVersion)]
```

To confirm this worked, run `./pants help protobuf_library`, and you should see your new field.
