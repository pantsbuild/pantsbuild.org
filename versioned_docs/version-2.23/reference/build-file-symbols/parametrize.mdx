<BuildFileSymbol name={`parametrize`} signature={`(*args: 'str', **kwargs: 'Any') -> 'None'`}>

A builtin function/dataclass that can be used to parametrize Targets.

Parametrization is applied between TargetAdaptor construction and Target instantiation, which means that individual Field instances need not be aware of it.
