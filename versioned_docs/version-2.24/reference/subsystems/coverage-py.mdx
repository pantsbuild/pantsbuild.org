Configuration for Python test coverage measurement.

This version of Pants uses `coverage` version 7.6.1 by default. Use a dedicated lockfile and the `install_from_resolve` option to control this.

Backend: <span className="color--primary">`pants.backend.python`</span>

Config section: <span className="color--primary">`[coverage-py]`</span>

## Basic options

### `fail_under`

<Option
  cli_repr={`--coverage-py-fail-under=<float>`}
  env_repr='PANTS_COVERAGE_PY_FAIL_UNDER'
  toml_repr={`[coverage-py]
fail_under = <float>`}
  default_repr={`None`}
>

Fail if the total combined coverage percentage for all tests is less than this number.

Use this instead of setting `fail_under` in a coverage.py config file, as the config will apply to each test separately, while you typically want this to apply to the combined coverage for all tests run.

Note that you must generate at least one (non-raw) coverage report for this check to trigger.

Note also that if you specify a non-integral value, you must also set `[report] precision` properly in the coverage.py config file to make use of the decimal places. See https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config.html.

</Option>

### `filter`

<Option
  cli_repr={`--coverage-py-filter="['<str>', '<str>', ...]"`}
  env_repr='PANTS_COVERAGE_PY_FILTER'
  toml_repr={`[coverage-py]
filter = [
    '<str>',
    '<str>',
    ...,
]`}
  default_repr={`[]`}
>

A list of Python modules or filesystem paths to use in the coverage report, e.g. `['helloworld_test', 'helloworld/util/dirutil']`.

For including files without any test in coverage calculation pass paths instead of modules. Paths need to be relative to the `pants.toml`.

Both modules and directory paths are recursive: any submodules or child paths, respectively, will be included.

If you leave this off, the coverage report will include every file in the transitive closure of the address/file arguments; for example, `test ::` will include every Python file in your project, whereas `test project/app_test.py` will include `app_test.py` and any of its transitive dependencies.

</Option>

### `global_report`

<Option
  cli_repr={`--[no-]coverage-py-global-report`}
  env_repr='PANTS_COVERAGE_PY_GLOBAL_REPORT'
  toml_repr={`[coverage-py]
global_report = <bool>`}
  default_repr={`False`}
>

If true, Pants will generate a global coverage report.

The global report will include all Python source files in the workspace and not just those depended on by the tests that were run.

</Option>

### `report`

<Option
  cli_repr={`--coverage-py-report="[<CoverageReportType>, <CoverageReportType>, ...]"`}
  env_repr='PANTS_COVERAGE_PY_REPORT'
  toml_repr={`[coverage-py]
report = [
    <CoverageReportType>,
    <CoverageReportType>,
    ...,
]`}
  one_of='console, xml, html, raw, json, lcov'
  default_repr={`[\n  "console"\n]`}
>

Which coverage report type(s) to emit.

</Option>

## Advanced options

### `config`

<Option
  cli_repr={`--coverage-py-config=<file_option>`}
  env_repr='PANTS_COVERAGE_PY_CONFIG'
  toml_repr={`[coverage-py]
config = <file_option>`}
  default_repr={`None`}
>

Path to an INI or TOML config file understood by coverage.py (https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config.html).

Setting this option will disable `[coverage-py].config_discovery`. Use this option if the config is located in a non-standard location.

</Option>

### `config_discovery`

<Option
  cli_repr={`--[no-]coverage-py-config-discovery`}
  env_repr='PANTS_COVERAGE_PY_CONFIG_DISCOVERY'
  toml_repr={`[coverage-py]
config_discovery = <bool>`}
  default_repr={`True`}
>

If true, Pants will include any relevant config files during runs (`.coveragerc`, `setup.cfg`, `tox.ini`, and `pyproject.toml`).

Use `[coverage-py].config` instead if your config is in a non-standard location.

</Option>

### `console_script`

<Option
  cli_repr={`--coverage-py-console-script=<str>`}
  env_repr='PANTS_COVERAGE_PY_CONSOLE_SCRIPT'
  toml_repr={`[coverage-py]
console_script = <str>`}
  default_repr={`coverage`}
>

The console script for the tool. Using this option is generally preferable to (and mutually exclusive with) specifying an `--entry-point` since console script names have a higher expectation of staying stable across releases of the tool. Usually, you will not want to change this from the default.

</Option>

### `entry_point`

<Option
  cli_repr={`--coverage-py-entry-point=<str>`}
  env_repr='PANTS_COVERAGE_PY_ENTRY_POINT'
  toml_repr={`[coverage-py]
entry_point = <str>`}
  default_repr={`None`}
>

The entry point for the tool. Generally you only want to use this option if the tool does not offer a `--console-script` (which this option is mutually exclusive with). Usually, you will not want to change this from the default.

</Option>

### `install_from_resolve`

<Option
  cli_repr={`--coverage-py-install-from-resolve=<str>`}
  env_repr='PANTS_COVERAGE_PY_INSTALL_FROM_RESOLVE'
  toml_repr={`[coverage-py]
install_from_resolve = <str>`}
  default_repr={`None`}
>

If specified, install the tool using the lockfile for this named resolve.

This resolve must be defined in `[python].resolves`, as described in https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.24/docs/python/overview/lockfiles#lockfiles-for-tools.

The resolve&#x27;s entire lockfile will be installed, unless specific requirements are listed via the `requirements` option, in which case only those requirements will be installed. This is useful if you don&#x27;t want to invalidate the tool&#x27;s outputs when the resolve incurs changes to unrelated requirements.

If unspecified, and the `lockfile` option is unset, the tool will be installed using the default lockfile shipped with Pants, which uses `coverage` version 7.6.1.

If unspecified, and the `lockfile` option is set, the tool will use the custom `coverage-py` &#x22;tool lockfile&#x22; generated from the `version` and `extra_requirements` options. But note that this mechanism is deprecated.

</Option>

### `interpreter_constraints`

<Option
  cli_repr={`--coverage-py-interpreter-constraints="['<str>', '<str>', ...]"`}
  env_repr='PANTS_COVERAGE_PY_INTERPRETER_CONSTRAINTS'
  toml_repr={`[coverage-py]
interpreter_constraints = [
    '<str>',
    '<str>',
    ...,
]`}
  default_repr={`[\n  "CPython>=3.8,<4"\n]`}
>

Python interpreter constraints for this tool.

</Option>

### `output_dir`

<Option
  cli_repr={`--coverage-py-output-dir=<str>`}
  env_repr='PANTS_COVERAGE_PY_OUTPUT_DIR'
  toml_repr={`[coverage-py]
output_dir = <str>`}
  default_repr={`{distdir}/coverage/python`}
>

Path to write the Pytest Coverage report to. Must be relative to the build root.

</Option>

### `requirements`

<Option
  cli_repr={`--coverage-py-requirements="['<str>', '<str>', ...]"`}
  env_repr='PANTS_COVERAGE_PY_REQUIREMENTS'
  toml_repr={`[coverage-py]
requirements = [
    '<str>',
    '<str>',
    ...,
]`}
  default_repr={`[]`}
>

If `install_from_resolve` is specified, install these requirements, at the versions provided by the specified resolve&#x27;s lockfile.

Values can be pip-style requirements (e.g., `tool` or `tool==1.2.3` or `tool>=1.2.3`), or addresses of `python_requirement` targets (or targets that generate or depend on `python_requirement` targets). Make sure to use the `//` prefix to refer to targets using their full address from the root (e.g. `//3rdparty/python:tool`). This is necessary to distinguish address specs from local or VCS requirements.

The lockfile will be validated against the requirements - if a lockfile doesn&#x27;t provide the requirement (at a suitable version, if the requirement specifies version constraints) Pants will error.

If unspecified, install the entire lockfile.
