## `tags`

<Field
    type_repr={`field.type_hint`}
>

Arbitrary strings to describe a target.

For example, you may tag some test targets with &#x27;integration_test&#x27; so that you could run `/home/josh/work/scie-pants/dist/scie-pants-linux-x86_64 --tag='integration_test' test ::` to only run on targets with that tag.

</Field>

## `description`

<Field
    type_repr={`field.type_hint`}
>

A human-readable description of the target.

Use `/home/josh/work/scie-pants/dist/scie-pants-linux-x86_64 list --documented ::` to see all targets with descriptions.

</Field>

## `output_path`

<Field
    type_repr={`field.type_hint`}
>

Where the built asset should be located.

If undefined, this will use the path to the BUILD file, followed by the target name. For example, `src/python/project:app` would be `src.python.project/app.ext`.

When running `/home/josh/work/scie-pants/dist/scie-pants-linux-x86_64 package`, this path will be prefixed by `--distdir` (e.g. `dist/`).

Warning: setting this value risks naming collisions with other package targets you may have.

</Field>

## `dependencies`

<Field
    type_repr={`field.type_hint`}
>

Addresses to other targets that this target depends on, e.g. [&#x27;helloworld/subdir:lib&#x27;, &#x27;helloworld/main.py:lib&#x27;, &#x27;3rdparty:reqs#django&#x27;].

This augments any dependencies inferred by Pants, such as by analyzing your imports. Use `/home/josh/work/scie-pants/dist/scie-pants-linux-x86_64 dependencies` or `/home/josh/work/scie-pants/dist/scie-pants-linux-x86_64 peek` on this target to get the final result.

See https://www.pantsbuild.org/v2.11/docs/targets#target-addresses and https://www.pantsbuild.org/v2.11/docs/targets#target-generation for more about how addresses are formed, including for generated targets. You can also run `/home/josh/work/scie-pants/dist/scie-pants-linux-x86_64 list ::` to find all addresses in your project, or `/home/josh/work/scie-pants/dist/scie-pants-linux-x86_64 list dir:` to find all addresses defined in that directory.

If the target is in the same BUILD file, you can leave off the BUILD file path, e.g. `:tgt` instead of `helloworld/subdir:tgt`. For generated first-party addresses, use `./` for the file path, e.g. `./main.py:tgt`; for all other generated targets, use `:tgt#generated_name`.

You may exclude dependencies by prefixing with `!`, e.g. `['!helloworld/subdir:lib', '!./sibling.txt']`. Ignores are intended for false positives with dependency inference; otherwise, simply leave off the dependency from the BUILD file.

</Field>

## `handler`

<Field
    type_repr={`field.type_hint`}
>

Entry point to the Google Cloud Function handler.

You can specify a full module like &#x27;path.to.module:handler_func&#x27; or use a shorthand to specify a file name, using the same syntax as the `sources` field, e.g. &#x27;cloud_function.py:handler_func&#x27;.

You must use the file name shorthand for file arguments to work with this target.

</Field>

## `runtime`

<Field
    type_repr={`field.type_hint`}
>

The identifier of the Google Cloud Function runtime to target (pythonXY). See https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/concepts/python-runtime.

</Field>

## `complete_platforms`

<Field
    type_repr={`field.type_hint`}
>

The platforms the built PEX should be compatible with.

There must be built wheels available for all of the foreign platforms, rather than sdists.

You can give a list of multiple complete platforms to create a multiplatform PEX, meaning that the PEX will be executable in all of the supported environments.

Complete platforms should be addresses of `file` targets that point to files that contain complete platform JSON as described by Pex (https://pex.readthedocs.io/en/latest/buildingpex.html#complete-platform).

</Field>

## `type`

<Field
    type_repr={`field.type_hint`}
>

The trigger type of the cloud function. Can either be &#x27;event&#x27; or &#x27;http&#x27;. See https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/concepts/python-runtime for reference to --trigger-http.

</Field>

## `resolve`

<Field
    type_repr={`field.type_hint`}
>

The resolve from `[python].resolves` to use.

If not defined, will default to `[python].default_resolve`.

All dependencies must share the same value for their `resolve` field.

</Field>
