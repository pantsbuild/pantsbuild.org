We are pleased to announce Pants [2.23.0](<(https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/tree/2.23.x/src/python/pants/notes/2.23.x.md)>), the latest release of [Pantsbuild, the scalable and ergonomic build system](https://www.pantsbuild.org/). To update, set `pants_version = "2.23.0"` in your `pants.toml`. If you're not using Pants yet, [get started now](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.23/docs/getting-started).

The previous release, 2.22.0, suffered from delays in its release cycle. So this 2.23.0 release is a relatively fast follow, and does not introduce major upheavals.

A couple of administrative reminders:

- The annual [Pants user survey](https://www.pantsbuild.org/blog/2024/10/08/user-survey-2024) is open through the end of 2024. The results will be used to assist the Pants maintainers and contributors to better understand areas where Pants may need work, so your feedback is vital!
- We're very proud that Pants now has its first [sponsors](https://www.pantsbuild.org/sponsors)! We are very grateful to [Klayvio](https://www.klaviyo.com/) and [Normal Computing](https://normalcomputing.ai/) for their Platinum tier support, and to [Continua](https://www.continua.ai/) and Stormfish for their Silver tier support.
  Sponsoring is a way for companies that use Pants to support the project while engaging more closely with the community. Want to support Pants? Find out more about our [sponsorship opportunities](https://www.pantsbuild.org/sponsorship) and the associated benefits at each tier.

_Highlights in [2.23](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/tree/2.23.x/src/python/pants/notes/2.23.x.md) include_:

- üåñ Due to deprecations by GitHub, the minimum supported glibc version for Pants wheels is now 2.28. Unless you are running Pants with in-repo plugins on a Linux distro from before 2018, this should have no effect.
- ‚ú® A new backend for the [buildifier](https://github.com/bazelbuild/buildtools/blob/main/buildifier/README.md) BUILD file formatter.
- üîç Two new experimental backends: [nFPM](https://github.com/goreleaser/nfpm) and [Trufflehog](https://github.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog). Try them out and [let us know](https://www.pantsbuild.org/community/getting-help) how it goes!
- üîÄ Better dependency inference for Dockerfiles.
- üöâ Improvements to platform handling in Python function-as-a-service targets.
- ‚õ∞Ô∏è Enhancements to Terraform lockfiles and caching.
- üìà And lots of smaller features, update, bugfixes, and general improvements.

As in the previous release, in 2.23.x we continue to run both the new and the legacy options systems concurrently and compare the results, issuing warnings if there are any discrepancies. If you do encounter discrepancies that you can't resolve on your own, please [reach out to us!](https://www.pantsbuild.org/community/getting-help).

Check out the [full release notes](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/tree/2.23.x/src/python/pants/notes/2.23.x.md). Pants is an open-source project, and the changes are all contributed by our community. If you want to see something more in the next changelog, join us on [GitHub](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants) and become a contributor.

As mentioned above, we offer [formal sponsorship tiers for companies](https://www.pantsbuild.org/sponsorship), as well as individual sponsorships via [GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/pantsbuild). These help pay for the ongoing development and hosting costs, and are managed by the Pants Build non-profit organization.
