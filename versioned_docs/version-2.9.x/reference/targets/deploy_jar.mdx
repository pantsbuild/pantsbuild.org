---

A `jar` file with first and third-party code bundled for deploys.

The JAR will contain class files for both first-party code and third-party dependencies, all in a common directory structure.

## `tags`

<Field
    type_repr={`field.type_hint`}
>

Arbitrary strings to describe a target.

For example, you may tag some test targets with &#x27;integration_test&#x27; so that you could run `./pants --tag='integration_test' test ::` to only run on targets with that tag.

</Field>

## `description`

<Field
    type_repr={`field.type_hint`}
>

A human-readable description of the target.

Use `./pants list --documented ::` to see all targets with descriptions.

</Field>

## `dependencies`

<Field
    type_repr={`field.type_hint`}
>

Addresses to other targets that this target depends on, e.g. [&#x27;helloworld/subdir:lib&#x27;, &#x27;helloworld/main.py:lib&#x27;, &#x27;3rdparty:reqs#django&#x27;].

This augments any dependencies inferred by Pants, such as by analyzing your imports. Use `./pants dependencies` or `./pants peek` on this target to get the final result.

See https://www.pantsbuild.org/v2.9/docs/targets#target-addresses and https://www.pantsbuild.org/v2.9/docs/targets#target-generation for more about how addresses are formed, including for generated targets. You can also run `./pants list ::` to find all addresses in your project, or `./pants list dir:` to find all addresses defined in that directory.

If the target is in the same BUILD file, you can leave off the BUILD file path, e.g. `:tgt` instead of `helloworld/subdir:tgt`. For generated first-party addresses, use `./` for the file path, e.g. `./main.py:tgt`; for all other generated targets, use `:tgt#generated_name`.

You may exclude dependencies by prefixing with `!`, e.g. `['!helloworld/subdir:lib', '!./sibling.txt']`. Ignores are intended for false positives with dependency inference; otherwise, simply leave off the dependency from the BUILD file.

</Field>

## `output_path`

<Field
    type_repr={`field.type_hint`}
>

Where the built asset should be located.

If undefined, this will use the path to the BUILD file, followed by the target name. For example, `src/python/project:app` would be `src.python.project/app.ext`.

When running `./pants package`, this path will be prefixed by `--distdir` (e.g. `dist/`).

Warning: setting this value risks naming collisions with other package targets you may have.

</Field>

## `main`

<Field
    type_repr={`field.type_hint`}
>

`.`-separated name of the JVM class containing the `main()` method to be called when executing this JAR.

</Field>

## `resolve`

<Field
    type_repr={`field.type_hint`}
>

The name of the resolve to use when building this target.

If not defined, will default to `[jvm].default_resolve`.

The name must be defined as a resolve in `[jvm].resolves`.

</Field>
