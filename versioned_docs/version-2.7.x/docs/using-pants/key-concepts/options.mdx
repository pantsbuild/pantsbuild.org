A deep dive into how options may be configured.

## Option scopes

Options are partitioned into named _scopes_.

Some systemwide options belong in the _global scope_. For example, the `--level` option, which controls the logging level, is in the global scope.

Other options belong to a _subsystem scope_. A _subsystem_ is simply a collection of related options, in a scope. For example, the `source` subsystem contains options related to [source roots](./source-roots).

## Setting options

Every option can be set in the following ways, in order of precedence:

1. Via a command line flag.
2. In an environment variable.
3. In the config file.

If an option isn't set in one of these ways, it will take on a default value.

You can inspect both the current value and the default value by using `./pants help $scope` or `./pants help-advanced $scope`.

### Command-line flags

Global options are set using an unqualified flag:

```bash
./pants --level=debug ...
```

Subsystem options are set by providing the flag, with the name prefixed with the lower-case scope name and a dash. So for the option `--root-patterns` in the scope `source`:

```bash
./pants --source-root-patterns="['^ext']"
```

### Environment variables

Global options are set using the environment variable `PANTS_{OPTION_NAME}`:

```bash
PANTS_LEVEL=debug ./pants ...
```

Subsystem options are set using the environment variable
`PANTS_{SCOPE}_{OPTION_NAME}`:

```bash
PANTS_SOURCE_ROOT_PATTERNS="['^ext']" ./pants ...
```

Note that the scope and option name are upper-cased, and any dashes in the option flag name are converted to underscores: `--multiword-name` becomes `MULTIWORD_NAME`.

### Config file entries

Global options are set in the `GLOBAL` section of the config file:

```toml
[GLOBAL]
level = "debug"
```

Subsystem options are set in the section named for their scope:

```toml
[source]
root_patterns = ["/src/python"]
```

Note that any dashes in the option flag name are converted to underscores: `--multiword-name` becomes `multiword_name`.

Additionally, a few different variables may be interpolated into strings in config files via a `%(var)s` syntax. For example, this expands to the absolute path of a file in the root of your repository:

```toml
[GLOBAL]
pythonpath = ["%(buildroot)s/examples"]
```

## Option types

Every option has a type, and any values you set must be of that type.

The option types are:

- string
- integer
- bool
- list
- dict

A list-valued option may also declare a specific type for its members (e.g., a list of strings, or a list of integers).

### String and integer values

Standalone string and integer values are written without quotes. Any quotes will be considered part of the value, after shell escaping.

#### Command-line flags:

```bash
./pants --scope-intopt=42
./pants --scope-stropt=qux
```

#### Environment variables:

```bash
PANTS_SCOPE_INTOPT=42
PANTS_SCOPE_STROPT=qux
```

#### Config file entries:

```toml
[scope]
intopt = 42
stropt = "qux"
```

### Boolean values

Boolean values can be specified using the special strings `true` and `false`. When specifying them via command-line flags you can also use the `--boolflag/--no-boolflag` syntax.

#### Command-line flags:

```bash
./pants --scope-boolopt=true
./pants --scope-boolopt
./pants --no-scope-boolopt
```

#### Environment variables:

```bash
PANTS_SCOPE_BOOLOPT=true
```

#### Config file entries:

```toml
[scope]
boolopt = true
```

### List values

List values are parsed as Python list literals, so you must quote string values, and you may need to apply shell-level quoting and/or escaping, as required.

#### Command-line flags:

```bash
./pants --scope-listopt="['foo','bar']"
```

#### Environment variables:

```bash
PANTS_SCOPE_LISTOPT="['foo','bar']"
```

#### Config file entries:

```toml
[scope]
listopt = [
  'foo',
  'bar'
]
```

List values have some extra semantics:

- A value can be preceded by `+`, which will _append_ the elements to the value obtained from lower-precedence sources.
- A value can be preceded by `-`, which will _remove_ the elements from the value obtained from lower-precedence sources.
- Multiple `+` and `-` values can be provided, separated by commas.
- Otherwise, the value _replaces_ the one obtained from lower-precedence sources.

For example, if the value of `--listopt` in `scope` is set to `[1, 2]` in a config file, then

```bash
./pants --scope-listopt="+[3,4]"
```

will set the value to `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.

```bash
./pants --scope-listopt="-[1],+[3,4]"
```

will set the value to `[2, 3, 4]`, and

```bash
./pants --scope-listopt="[3,4]"
```

will set the value to `[3, 4]`.

:::note Add/remove syntax in .toml files
The +/- syntax works in .toml files, but the entire value must be quoted:

```toml
[scope]
listopt = "+[1,2],-[3,4]"
```

This means that TOML treats the value as a string, instead of a TOML list.

Alternatively, you can use this syntactic sugar, which allows the values to be regular TOML lists:

```toml
[scope]
listopt.add = [1, 2]
listopt.remove = [3, 4]
```

But note that this only works in Pants's .toml config files, not in environment variables or command-line flags.

### Dict values

Dict values are parsed as Python dict literals, so you must quote string keys and values, and you may need to apply shell-level quoting and/or escaping, as required.

#### Command-line flags:

```bash
./pants --scope-dictopt="{'foo':1,'bar':2}"
```

#### Environment variables:

```bash
PANTS_SCOPE_DICTOPT="{'foo':1,'bar':2}"
```

#### Config file entries:

```toml
[scope]
dictopt = """{
  'foo': 1,
  'bar': 2
}"""
# Note that dict values in .toml files must be quoted.
```

Dict values have some extra semantics:

- A value can be preceded by `+`, which will _update_ the value obtained from lower-precedence sources with the entries.
- Otherwise, the value _replaces_ the one obtained from lower-precendence sources.

For example, if the value of `--dictopt` in `scope` is set to `{'foo', 1, 'bar': 2}` in a config file, then

```bash
./pants --scope-dictopt="+{'foo':42,'baz':3}"
```

will set the value to `{'foo': 42, 'bar': 2, 'baz': 3}`, and

```bash
./pants --scope-dictopt="{'foo':42,'baz':3}"
```

will set the value to `{'foo': 42, 'baz': 3}`.
