Intel-based Macs are [on their way out](https://mbsdirect.com/mbs-blog/article-upgrade-soon-intel-based-macs-and-apps-are-on-their-way-out). The transition to Apple Silicon hardware has been ongoing for the past 5 years, and the recently released macOS Tahoe is the last macOS version to support the x86_64 platform.

We currently release Pants for macOS on x86_64, but it is becoming increasingly laborious and costly to do so. GitHub's macos-13 runner was deprecated recently and will be fully unsupported in a few weeks. So we would like to begin considering our timeline for dropping macOS Intel support. And you can help us!

Do you use Pants on Intel Macs? Do you intend to do so indefinitely, or do you have a target date for your own migration off that platform? Regardless of your own usage, do you have opinions on this topic?

Please let us know by chiming in on [this GitHub discussion](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/discussions/22711)! We look forward to a spirited and courteous conversation. Thanks!
