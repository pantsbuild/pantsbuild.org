pants fmt [args]
```

Autoformat source code.

This goal runs tools that make &#x27;syntactic&#x27; changes to source code, where the meaning of the code doesn&#x27;t (usually) change.

See also:

- [The `fix` goal](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.30/reference/goals/fix) will run code-editing tools that may make semantic
  changes, not just syntactic ones.

- [The `lint` goal](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.30/reference/goals/lint) will validate code is formatted, by running these
  formatters and checking there&#x27;s no change.

- Documentation about formatters for various ecosystems, such as:
  [Python](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.30/docs/python/overview/linters-and-formatters), [Go](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.30/docs/go#gofmt),
  [JVM](https://www.pantsbuild.org/jvm/java-and-scala#lint-and-format), [Shell](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.30/docs/shell#shfmt-autoformatter).

## Basic options

### `only`

<Option
  cli_repr={`--fmt-only="['<str>', '<str>', ...]"`}
  env_repr='PANTS_FMT_ONLY'
  toml_repr={`[fmt]
only = [
    '<str>',
    '<str>',
    ...,
]`}
  default_repr={`[]`}
>

Only run these formatters and skip all others.

The formatter names are outputted at the final summary of running this goal, e.g. `isort` and `shfmt`. You can also run `fmt --only=fake` to get a list of all activated formatters.

You can repeat this option, e.g. `fmt --only=isort --only=shfmt` or `fmt --only=['isort', 'shfmt']`.

</Option>

## Advanced options

### `batch_size`

<Option
  cli_repr={`--fmt-batch-size=<int>`}
  env_repr='PANTS_FMT_BATCH_SIZE'
  toml_repr={`[fmt]
batch_size = <int>`}
  default_repr={`128`}
>

The target number of files to be included in each formatter batch.

Formatter processes are batched for a few reasons:

1. to avoid OS argument length limits (in processes which don&#x27;t support argument files)
2. to support more stable cache keys than would be possible if all files were operated on in a single batch.
3. to allow for parallelism in formatter processes which don&#x27;t have internal parallelism, or -- if they do support internal parallelism -- to improve scheduling behavior when multiple processes are competing for cores and so internal parallelism cannot be used perfectly.

In order to improve cache hit rates (see 2.), batches are created at stable boundaries, and so this value is only a &#x22;target&#x22; batch size (rather than an exact value).
