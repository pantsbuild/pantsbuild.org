An object containing differing homogeneous platform-dependent values.

The values should be evaluated for the execution environment, and not the host environment (I.e. it should be evaluated in a `rule` which requests `Platform`).

Expected usage is roughly:

```python class MyFieldType(...):
    value = str | per_platform[str]

    @classmethod
    def compute_value( # type: ignore[override]
        cls,
        raw_value: Optional[Union[str, per_platform[str]]],
        address: Address,
    ) -> Optional[Union[str, per_platform[str]]]:
        if isinstance(raw_value, per_platform):
            # NOTE: Ensure the values are homogeneous
            raw_value.check_types(str)

        return raw_value

...

@rule async def my_rule(..., platform: Platform) -> ...:
    field_value = target[MyFieldType].value

    if isinstance(field_value, per_platform):
        field_value = field_value.get_value_for_platform(platform)

    ...
```

NOTE: Support for this object should be heavily weighed, as it would be inappropriate to use in certain contexts (such as the `source` field in a `foo_source` target, where the intent is to support differing source files based on platform. The result would be that dependency inference (and therefore the dependencies field) wouldn&#x27;t be knowable on the host, which is not something the engine can support yet).
