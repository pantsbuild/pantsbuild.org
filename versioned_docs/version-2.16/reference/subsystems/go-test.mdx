Options for Go tests.

Backend: <span className="color--primary">`pants.backend.experimental.go`</span>

Config section: <span className="color--primary">`[go-test]`</span>

<span className={styles.options}>

## Basic options

### `args`

<Option
  cli_repr={`--go-test-args="[<shell_str>, <shell_str>, ...]", ... -- [<shell_str> [<shell_str> [...]]]`}
  env_repr='PANTS_GO_TEST_ARGS'
  default_repr={`[]`}
>

Arguments to pass directly to Go test binary, e.g. `--go-test-args='-run TestFoo -v'`.

Known Go test options will be transformed into the form expected by the test binary, e.g. `-v` becomes `-test.v`. Run `go help testflag` from the Go SDK to learn more about the options supported by Go test binaries.

</Option>

### `cover_mode`

<Option
  cli_repr={`--go-test-cover-mode=<GoCoverMode>`}
  env_repr='PANTS_GO_TEST_COVER_MODE'
  one_of='set, count, atomic'
  default_repr={`set`}
>

Coverage mode to use when running Go tests with coverage analysis enabled via --test-use-coverage. Valid values are `set`, `count`, and `atomic`:

- `set`: bool: does this statement run?

- `count`: int: how many times does this statement run?

- `atomic`: int: count, but correct in multithreaded tests; significantly more expensive.

</Option>

### `coverage_html`

<Option
  cli_repr={`--[no-]go-test-coverage-html`}
  env_repr='PANTS_GO_TEST_COVERAGE_HTML'
  default_repr={`True`}
>

If true, then convert coverage reports to HTML format and write a `coverage.html` file next to the raw coverage data.

</Option>

### `coverage_packages`

<Option
  cli_repr={`--go-test-coverage-packages="['<str>', '<str>', ...]"`}
  env_repr='PANTS_GO_TEST_COVERAGE_PACKAGES'
  default_repr={`[]`}
>

A list of &quot;import path patterns&quot; for determining which import paths will be instrumented for code coverage.

From `go help packages`:

An import path is a pattern if it includes one or more &quot;...&quot; wildcards, each of which can match any string, including the empty string and strings containing slashes. Such a pattern expands to all package directories found in the GOPATH trees with names matching the patterns.

To make common patterns more convenient, there are two special cases. First, /... at the end of the pattern can match an empty string, so that net/... matches both net and packages in its subdirectories, like net/http. Second, any slash-separated pattern element containing a wildcard never participates in a match of the &quot;vendor&quot; element in the path of a vendored package, so that ./... does not match packages in subdirectories of ./vendor or ./mycode/vendor, but ./vendor/... and ./mycode/vendor/... do. Note, however, that a directory named vendor that itself contains code is not a vendored package: cmd/vendor would be a command named vendor, and the pattern cmd/... matches it. See golang.org/s/go15vendor for more about vendoring.

This option is similar to the `go test -coverpkg` option, but without support currently for reserved import path patterns like `std` and `all`.

</Option>

### `skip`

<Option
  cli_repr={`--[no-]go-test-skip`}
  env_repr='PANTS_GO_TEST_SKIP'
  default_repr={`False`}
>

If true, don&#x27;t use Go test binary when running `scie-pants-linux-x86_64 test`.

</Option>

### `force_race`

<Option
  cli_repr={`--[no-]go-test-force-race`}
  env_repr='PANTS_GO_TEST_FORCE_RACE'
  default_repr={`False`}
>

If true, then always enable the Go data race detector when running tests regardless of the test-by-test `test_race` field on the relevant `go_package` target.

See https://go.dev/doc/articles/race_detector for additional information about the Go data race detector.

</Option>

### `force_msan`

<Option
  cli_repr={`--[no-]go-test-force-msan`}
  env_repr='PANTS_GO_TEST_FORCE_MSAN'
  default_repr={`False`}
>

If true, then always enable interoperation between Go and the C/C++ &quot;memory sanitizer&quot; when running tests regardless of the test-by-test `msan` field on the relevant `go_package` target.

See https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/MemorySanitizer for additional information about the C/C++ memory sanitizer.

</Option>

### `force_asan`

<Option
  cli_repr={`--[no-]go-test-force-asan`}
  env_repr='PANTS_GO_TEST_FORCE_ASAN'
  default_repr={`False`}
>

If true, then always enable interoperation between Go and the C/C++ &quot;address sanitizer&quot; when running tests regardless of the test-by-test `asan` field on the relevant `go_package` target.

See https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/AddressSanitizer for additional information about the C/C++ address sanitizer.

</Option>

### `block_profile`

<Option
  cli_repr={`--[no-]go-test-block-profile`}
  env_repr='PANTS_GO_TEST_BLOCK_PROFILE'
  default_repr={`False`}
>

Capture a goroutine blocking profile from the execution of the test runner. The profile will be written to the file `block.out` in the test extra output directory. The test binary will also be written to the test extra output directory.

</Option>

### `cpu_profile`

<Option
  cli_repr={`--[no-]go-test-cpu-profile`}
  env_repr='PANTS_GO_TEST_CPU_PROFILE'
  default_repr={`False`}
>

Capture a CPU profile from the execution of the test runner. The profile will be written to the file `cpu.out` in the test extra output directory. The test binary will also be written to the test extra output directory.

</Option>

### `mem_profile`

<Option
  cli_repr={`--[no-]go-test-mem-profile`}
  env_repr='PANTS_GO_TEST_MEM_PROFILE'
  default_repr={`False`}
>

Capture an allocation profile from the execution of the test runner after tests have passed. The profile will be written to the file `mem.out` in the test extra output directory. The test binary will also be written to the test extra output directory.

</Option>

### `mutex_profile`

<Option
  cli_repr={`--[no-]go-test-mutex-profile`}
  env_repr='PANTS_GO_TEST_MUTEX_PROFILE'
  default_repr={`False`}
>

Capture a mutex contention profile from the execution of the test runner when all tests are complete. The profile will be written to the file `mutex.out` in the test extra output directory. The test binary will also be written to the test extra output directory.

</Option>

### `trace`

<Option
  cli_repr={`--[no-]go-test-trace`}
  env_repr='PANTS_GO_TEST_TRACE'
  default_repr={`False`}
>

Capture an execution trace from the execution of the test runner. The trace will be written to the file `trace.out` in the test extra output directory.

</Option>

## Advanced options

### `coverage_output_dir`

<Option
  cli_repr={`--go-test-coverage-output-dir=<str>`}
  env_repr='PANTS_GO_TEST_COVERAGE_OUTPUT_DIR'
  default_repr={`{distdir}/coverage/go/{target_spec}`}
>

Path to write the Go coverage reports to. Must be relative to the build root.

Replacements:

- `{distdir}` is replaced with the Pants `distdir`.

- `{target_spec}` is replaced with the address of the applicable `go_package` target with `/` characters replaced with dots (`.`).

- `{import_path}` is replaced with the applicable package&#x27;s import path. Subdirectories will be made for any path components separated by `/` characters.

- `{import_path_escaped}` is replaced with the applicable package&#x27;s import path but with slashes converted to underscores. This is deprecated and only exists to support behavior from earlier versions.

</Option>

### `output_test_binary`

<Option
  cli_repr={`--[no-]go-test-output-test-binary`}
  env_repr='PANTS_GO_TEST_OUTPUT_TEST_BINARY'
  default_repr={`False`}
>

Write the test binary to the test extra output directory.

This is similar to the `go test -c` option, but will still run the underlying test.

</Option>
