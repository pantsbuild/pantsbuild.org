# `/docs`

(See https://docusaurus.io/docs/docs-introduction for reference)

This directory holds the docs for the `main` branch.

The version associated with this directory is assumed to be one minor version bump from the latest
version docs.

By default, they don't show up in the dropdown on the production site, but going to `/<version>`
will work.
