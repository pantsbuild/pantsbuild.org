Some highlights:

- Added support for generating Python from Protocol Buffers (Protobuf). See [Protobuf](../../codegen/protobuf-and-grpc.mdx).
- Added the `junit_xml_dir` option to the `[pytest]` scope to allow saving JUnit XML test results. See [test](../../python/goals/test.mdx).
- Allow defining macros though a new "preludes" mechanism. See [Macros](../../writing-plugins/macros.mdx).
- Simplified how source roots are declared. See [Source roots](../../using-pants/concepts/source-roots.mdx).
- Added the `dependees` goal. See [Project introspection](../../using-pants/project-introspection.mdx).
- UI enhancements, including:
  - Improved the interactive UI to not take over the screen and to work when piping to other programs.
  - Improved output for `fmt` and `lint` to explain which tools ran.
  - Improved output for `test` to be less chatty.
