- ü™• New helpers for [defining "adhoc" code-quality tools](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.20/reference/targets/code_quality_tool), without requiring a full plugin.

- ‚ö† Pex's [`emit_warnings`](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.20/reference/subsystems/pex#emit_warnings) now works as advertised and comes with a [global option](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.20/reference/subsystems/pex#emit_warnings).
