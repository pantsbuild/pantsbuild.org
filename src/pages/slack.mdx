# Slack

The best place to become acquainted with Pants community members, exchange informal chat and ask
quick questions is at the project's Slack. You can join using [this link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf9zgf-MXRnVDJbrVEST3urqneq7LCcy0zw8qU-GH4hPMn52A/viewform?usp=sf_link).

We encourage you to introduce yourself in the #welcome channel!
