Hacking on the Pants engine in Rust.

---

We welcome contributions to Rust! We use Rust to implement the Pants engine in a performant, safe, and ergonomic way.

:::note Still learning Rust? Ask to get added to reviews
We'd be happy to ping you on Rust changes we make for you to see how Rust is used in the wild. Please message us on the #engine channel in [Slack](/community/members) to let us know your interest.
:::

:::caution Recommendation: share your plan first
Because changes to Rust deeply impact how Pants runs, it is especially helpful to share any plans to work on Rust before making changes. Please message us on [Slack](/community/members) in the #engine channel or open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/issues).

## Code organization

The code for the top-level Pants Rust crate lives in `src/rust/engine`. The top-level `Cargo.toml` file at `src/rust/engine/Cargo.toml` defines a cargo workspace containing a number of other subcrates, which live in subdirectories of `src/rust/engine`. Defining multiple subcrates in this way allows changes affecting one subcrate to avoid affecting other subcrates and triggering more recompilation than is necessary.

Several of the particularly important subcrates are:

- `graph`: the core of Pants's rule graph implementation.
- `ui`: the dynamic UI.
- `sharded_lmdb`: custom wrappers around the `crates.io` `lmdb` crate, which provides bindings to [lmdb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_Memory-Mapped_Database).
- `fs`: manipulating the filesystem.
- `process_execution`: running local and remote processes.

## Rust \<-\> Python interaction

Pants is best conceptualized as a Python program that makes frequent foreign function interface (FFI) calls into Rust code.

The top-level `engine` Rust crate gets compiled into a library named `native_engine.so`, which Python code knows how to interact with. We use the Rust [cpython](https://crates.io/crates/cpython) crate to manage foreign function interaction.

The C FFI functions that Rust code exposes as a public interface live in `src/rust/engine/src/externs/interface.rs`. On the Python side, the `native` module at `src/python/pants/engine/internals/native.py` contains wrappers around invocations of Rust functions and other FFI boilerplate.

Rust can also invoke Python functions and object constructors thanks to the [cpython](https://crates.io/crates/cpython) crate. Most of our helper code lives in `src/rust/engine/src/externs/mod.rs`.

We are planning to port additional functionality from Python to Rust, generally for performance reasons.

## Common commands

### Compile

Run `./pants` or `build-support/bin/native/cargo check --manifest-path src/rust/engine/Cargo.toml`.

:::caution Set `MODE=debug` when iterating
As described in [Setting up Pants](./setting-up-pants.mdx), we default to compiling Rust in release mode, rather than debug mode.

When working on Rust, you typically should set the environment variable `MODE=debug` for substantially faster compiles.
:::

### Run tests

To run tests for all crates, run:

```bash
build-support/bin/native/cargo test --manifest-path src/rust/engine/Cargo.toml
```

To run for a specific crate, such as the `fs` create, run:

```bash
build-support/bin/native/cargo test --manifest-path src/rust/engine/fs/Cargo.toml
```

To run for a specific test, use Cargo's filtering mechanism, e.g.:

```bash
build-support/bin/native/cargo test --manifest-path src/rust/engine/Cargo.toml read_file_missing
```

### Autoformat

```bash
build-support/bin/check_rust_formatting.sh -f
```

To run in lint mode, rather than format mode, do not pass the `-f` flag.

### Run Clippy

```bash
build-support/bin/check_clippy.sh
```

### Cargo commands

We have a wrapper script around `cargo` at `build_support/bin/native/cargo`. Use this for all Cargo operations in the Pants codebase.

## IDE setup (optional)

### IntelliJ

1. Bootstrap Pants's Rust toolchain by running `./pants`.
2. Install the Rust plugin (see IntelliJ Preferences).
3. Set Rust's `Toolchain location` to `build-support/bin/native`.
4. Set the `Standard library` to `build-support/bin/native/src`.

## The `fs_util` tool

`fs_util` is a utility that enables you to interact with `Snapshot`s from the command line. You can use it to help debug issues with snapshotted files.

To build it, run this from the root of the repository:

```bash
$ cd src/rust/engine && ../../../build-support/bin/native/cargo build -p fs_util
```

That will produce `src/rust/engine/target/debug/fs_util`.

To inspect a particular snapshot, you'll need to tell fs_util where the storage is and the digest and length of the snapshot to inspect. You can use the `--local-store-path` flag for that.

For example, this command pretty prints the recursive file list of a directory through the directory subcommand.

```bash
$ src/rust/engine/target/debug/fs_util --local-store-path=${HOME}/.cache/pants/lmdb_store directory cat-proto --output-format=recursive-file-list <digesh> <len>
```

Pass the `--help` flag to see other ways of using `fs_util`, along with its subcommands. Each subcommand can be passed the `--help` flag.
