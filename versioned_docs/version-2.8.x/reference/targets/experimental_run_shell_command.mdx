import Field from "@site/src/components/reference/Field";
import styles from "@site/src/components/reference/styles.module.css";

---

Run a script in the workspace, with all dependencies packaged/copied into a chroot.

Example BUILD file:

```
experimental_run_shell_command(
  command="./scripts/my-script.sh --data-files-dir={chroot}",
  dependencies=["src/project/files:data"],
)
```

The `command` may use either `{chroot}` on the command line, or the `$CHROOT` environment variable to get the root directory for where any dependencies are located.

In contrast to the `experimental_shell_command`, in addition to `workdir` you only have the `command` and `dependencies` fields as the `tools` you are going to use are already on the PATH which is inherited from the Pants environment. Also, the `outputs` does not apply, as any output files produced will end up directly in your project tree.

## `tags`

<Field
    type_repr={`field.type_hint`}
>

Arbitrary strings to describe a target.

For example, you may tag some test targets with &#x27;integration_test&#x27; so that you could run `./pants --tag='integration_test' test ::` to only run on targets with that tag.

</Field>

## `description`

<Field
    type_repr={`field.type_hint`}
>

A human-readable description of the target.

Use `./pants list --documented ::` to see all targets with descriptions.

</Field>

## `dependencies`

<Field
    type_repr={`field.type_hint`}
>

Addresses to other targets that this target depends on, e.g. [&#x27;helloworld/subdir:lib&#x27;].

Alternatively, you may include file names. Pants will find which target owns that file, and create a new target from that which only includes the file in its `sources` field. For files relative to the current BUILD file, prefix with `./`; otherwise, put the full path, e.g. [&#x27;./sibling.txt&#x27;, &#x27;resources/demo.json&#x27;].

You may exclude dependencies by prefixing with `!`, e.g. `['!helloworld/subdir:lib', '!./sibling.txt']`. Ignores are intended for false positives with dependency inference; otherwise, simply leave off the dependency from the BUILD file.

</Field>

## `command`

<Field
    type_repr={`field.type_hint`}
>

Shell command to execute.

The command is executed as &#x27;bash -c &lt;command&gt;&#x27; by default.

</Field>

## `workdir`

<Field
    type_repr={`field.type_hint`}
    default_repr={`'.'`}
>

Sets the current working directory of the command, relative to the project root.

</Field>
