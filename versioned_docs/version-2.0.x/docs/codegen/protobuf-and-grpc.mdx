How to generate Python from Protocol Buffers.

---

When you depend on a `protobuf_library` in a Python target (like a `python_library`), Pants will run the Protoc compiler to generate Python code that you can import and use like normal Python code.

:::note Example repository
See [the Python example repository](https://github.com/pantsbuild/example-python) for an example of using Protobuf to generate Python.
:::

## Step 1: Activate the Protobuf Python backend

Add this to your `pants.toml`:

```toml title="pants.toml"
[GLOBAL]
backend_packages.add = [
  "pants.backend.codegen.protobuf.python",
  "pants.backend.python",
]
```

This adds the new `protobuf_library` target, which you can confirm by running `./pants help protobuf_library`.

:::note Enable the MyPy Protobuf plugin
The [MyPy Protobuf plugin](https://github.com/dropbox/mypy-protobuf) generates [`.pyi` type stubs](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/stubs.html). If you use MyPy through Pants's [typecheck goal](../python/goals/typecheck.mdx), this will ensure MyPy understands your generated code.

To activate, set `mypy_plugin = true` in the `[python-protobuf]` scope:

```toml
[python-protobuf]
mypy_plugin = true
```

MyPy will use the generated `.pyi` type stub file, rather than looking at the `.py` implementation file.

:::caution Want to use other protocols, like Thrift?
Please message us on [Slack](/community/members) if you would like support for more protocols. We would be happy to either add support to the core Pants distribution or to help you to write a plugin.

## Step 2: Set up the `protobuf` and/or `grpcio` runtime libraries

Generated Python files require the [`protobuf` library](https://pypi.org/project/protobuf/) for their imports to work properly. If you're using gRPC, you also need the [`grpcio` library](https://pypi.org/project/grpcio/).

First, add `protobuf`—and `grpcio`, if relevant— to your `requirements.txt` (see [Third-party dependencies](../python/overview/third-party-dependencies.mdx)).

```text title="requirements.txt"
grpcio==1.32.0
protobuf>=3.12.1
```

Then, add the targets' addresses to the option `runtime_dependencies` in the `[python-protobuf]` scope. Pants will use this to automatically add the target(s) to the `dependencies` field for every `protobuf_library()` target you write.

```toml title="pants.toml"
[python-protobuf]
# Use the path to your 3rd-party requirements,
# e.g. `3rdparty/python:protobuf`.
runtime_dependencies = ["//:grpcio", "//:protobuf"]
```

## Step 3: Define a `protobuf_library` target

Wherever you create your `.proto` files, add a `protobuf_library`.

```python tab={"label":"src/proto/example/BUILD"}
# `sources` defaults to `['*.proto']`.
protobuf_library()
```

```text tab={"label":"src/proto/example/f.proto"}
syntax = "proto3";

package example;

message Example {
  ...
}
```

Your `protobuf_library` can optionally depend on other `protobuf_library` targets through the `dependencies` field, if its `.proto` files need to import definitions from other`.proto` files.

If you want gRPC code generated, set `grpc=True`.

```python title="src/proto/example/BUILD"
protobuf_library(grpc=True)
```

## Step 4: Use the `protobuf_library` in your Python code

Now, you can add the `protobuf_library` to the `dependencies` field of your Python targets. Pants will generate the Python code automatically for you.

In your Python file, import the module with the name `_pb2` at the end, e.g. `protos/example.proto` becomes `proto.example_pb2`.

If gRPC is activated, you can also import the module with `_pb2_grpc` at the end, e.g. `proto.example_pb2_grpc`.

```python tab={"label":"src/python/example/BUILD"}
python_library(
    dependencies=[
        "src/proto/example",
    ],
)
```

```python tab={"label":"src/python/example/app.py"}
from example.f_pb2 import Message

# See https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/pythontutorial
# for how to use the generated code in your project.
```

[Dependency inference](../using-pants/concepts/targets-and-build-files.mdx) does not work with Protobuf. You must explicitly declare all dependencies on `protobuf_library` targets.

:::caution You likely need to add empty `__init__.py` files
By default, Pants will generate the Python files in the same directory as the `.proto` file. To get Python imports working properly, you will likely need to add an empty `__init__.py` in the same location, and possibly in ancestor directories. You do not need to add a `python_library()` target; Pants will automatically include the file.

See the below section "Protobuf and source roots" for how to generate into a different directory. If you use this option, you will still likely need an empty `__init__.py` file in the destination directory.
:::

:::tip Upcoming feature: `export-codegen` goal
Pants 2.1 adds an `export-codegen` rule to write the files to the `dist/` dir.

If you are not yet able to upgrade to 2.1, for now, you can add the `protobuf_library()` as a dependency of a `pex_binary()`, then run `./pants package` on the binary target, and finally inspect the built PEX by using `unzip`.
:::

:::tip Upcoming feature: dependency inference for Protobuf
Pants 2.2 adds support for dependency inference of:

- Python imports of Protobuf files, including gRPC files.
- Protobuf dependencies on other Protobuf files.

:::

## Protobuf and source roots

By default, generated code goes into the same [source root](../using-pants/concepts/source-roots.mdx) as the `.proto` file from which it was generated. For example, a file `src/proto/example/f.proto` will generate `src/proto/example/f_pb2.py`.

However this may not always be what you want. In particular, you may not want to have to add `__init__py` files under `src/proto` just so you can import Python code generated to that source root.

You can configure a different source root for generated code by setting the `python_source_root` field:

```python title="src/proto/example/BUILD"
protobuf_library(
  python_source_root='src/python'
)
```

Now `src/proto/example/f.proto` will generate `src/python/example/f_pb2.py`, i.e., the generated files will share a source root with your other Python code.

:::note Set packages relative to the source root
Remember that the `package` directive in your `.proto` file should be relative to the source root.

For example, if you have a file at `src/proto/example/subdir/f.proto`, you'd set its `package` to `example.subdir`; and in your Python code, `from example.subdir import f_pb2`.
