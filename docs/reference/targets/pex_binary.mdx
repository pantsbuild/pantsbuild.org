A Python target that can be converted into an executable PEX file.

PEX files are self-contained executable files that contain a complete Python environment capable of running the target. For more information, see https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.31/docs/python/overview/pex.

## `args`

<Field
    type_repr={`Iterable[str] | None`}
    default_repr={`None`}
>

Freeze these command-line args into the PEX. Allows you to run generic entry points on specific arguments without creating a shim file.

This is different to `extra_build_args`: `args` records arguments used by the packaged PEX when executed, `extra_build_args` passes arguments to the process that does the packaging.

</Field>

## `check`

<Field
    type_repr={`'error' | 'none' | 'warn' | None`}
    default_repr={`'warn'`}
>

Check that the built PEX is valid. Currently this only applies to `--layout zipapp` where the PEX zip is tested for importability of its `__main__` module by the Python zipimport module. This check will fail for PEX zips that use ZIP64 extensions since the Python zipimport zipimporter only works with 32 bit zips. The check no-ops for all other layouts.

</Field>

## `complete_platforms`

<Field
    type_repr={`Iterable[str] | None`}
    default_repr={`None`}
>

The platforms the built PEX should be compatible with.

There must be built wheels available for all of the foreign platforms, rather than sdists.

You can give a list of multiple complete platforms to create a multiplatform PEX, meaning that the PEX will be executable in all of the supported environments.

Complete platforms should be addresses of `file` or `resource` targets that point to files that contain complete platform JSON as described by Pex (https://pex.readthedocs.io/en/latest/buildingpex.html#complete-platform).

See https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.31/docs/python/overview/pex#generating-the-complete_platforms-file for details on how to create this file.

</Field>

## `dependencies`

<Field
    type_repr={`Iterable[str] | None`}
    default_repr={`None`}
>

Addresses to other targets that this target depends on, e.g. `['helloworld/subdir:lib', 'helloworld/main.py:lib', '3rdparty:reqs#django']`.

This augments any dependencies inferred by Pants, such as by analyzing your imports. Use `pants dependencies` or `pants peek` on this target to get the final result.

See https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.31/docs/using-pants/key-concepts/targets-and-build-files for more about how addresses are formed, including for generated targets. You can also run `pants list ::` to find all addresses in your project, or `pants list dir` to find all addresses defined in that directory.

If the target is in the same BUILD file, you can leave off the BUILD file path, e.g. `:tgt` instead of `helloworld/subdir:tgt`. For generated first-party addresses, use `./` for the file path, e.g. `./main.py:tgt`; for all other generated targets, use `:tgt#generated_name`.

You may exclude dependencies by prefixing with `!`, e.g. `['!helloworld/subdir:lib', '!./sibling.txt']`. Ignores are intended for false positives with dependency inference; otherwise, simply leave off the dependency from the BUILD file.

</Field>

## `description`

<Field
    type_repr={`str | None`}
    default_repr={`None`}
>

A human-readable description of the target.

Use `pants list --documented ::` to see all targets with descriptions.

</Field>

## `emit_warnings`

<Field
    type_repr={`bool | None`}
    default_repr={`None`}
>

Whether or not to emit PEX warnings at runtime.

The default is determined by the option `emit_warnings` in the `[pex-binary-defaults]` scope.

</Field>

## `entry_point`

<Field
    type_repr={`str | None`}
    default_repr={`None`}
>

Set the entry point, i.e. what gets run when executing `./my_app.pex`, to a module.

You can specify a full module like `'path.to.module'` and `'path.to.module:func'`, or use a shorthand to specify a file name, using the same syntax as the `sources` field:

1. `'app.py'`, Pants will convert into the module `path.to.app`;
2. `'app.py:func'`, Pants will convert into `path.to.app:func`.

You may only set one of: this field, or the `script` field, or the `executable` field. Leave off all three fields to have no entry point.

</Field>

## `env`

<Field
    type_repr={`dict[str, str] | None`}
    default_repr={`None`}
>

Freeze these environment variables into the PEX. Allows you to run generic entry points on a specific environment without creating a shim file.

</Field>

## `environment`

<Field
    type_repr={`str | None`}
    default_repr={`'__local__'`}
>

Specify which environment target to consume environment-sensitive options from.

Once environments are defined in `[environments-preview].names`, you can specify the environment for this target by its name. Any fields that are defined in that environment will override the values from options set by `pants.toml`, command line values, or environment variables.

You can specify multiple valid environments by using `parametrize`. If `__local__` is specified, Pants will fall back to the `local_environment` defined for the current platform, or no environment if no such environment exists.

</Field>

## `executable`

<Field
    type_repr={`str | None`}
    default_repr={`None`}
>

Set the entry point, i.e. what gets run when executing `./my_app.pex`, to an execuatble local python script. This executable python script is typically something that cannot be imported so it cannot be used via `script` or `entry_point`.

You may only set one of: this field, or the `entry_point` field, or the `script` field. Leave off all three fields to have no entry point.

</Field>

## `execution_mode`

<Field
    type_repr={`'venv' | 'zipapp' | None`}
    default_repr={`'zipapp'`}
>

The mode the generated PEX file will run in.

The traditional PEX file runs in a modified &#x27;zipapp&#x27; mode (See: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0441/) where zipped internal code and dependencies are first unpacked to disk. This mode achieves the fastest cold start times and may, for example be the best choice for cloud lambda functions.

The fastest execution mode in the steady state is &#x27;venv&#x27;, which generates a virtual environment from the PEX file on first run, but then achieves near native virtual environment start times. This mode also benefits from a traditional virtual environment `sys.path`, giving maximum compatibility with stdlib and third party APIs.

</Field>

## `extra_build_args`

<Field
    type_repr={`Iterable[str] | None`}
    default_repr={`()`}
>

Extra arguments to pass to the `pex` invocation used to build this PEX. These are passed after all other arguments. This can be used to pass extra options that Pants doesn&#x27;t have built-in support for.

This is different to `args`: `args` records arguments used by the packaged PEX when executed, `extra_build_args` passes arguments to the process that does the packaging.

</Field>

## `ignore_errors`

<Field
    type_repr={`bool`}
    default_repr={`False`}
>

Should PEX ignore errors when it cannot resolve dependencies?

</Field>

## `include_requirements`

<Field
    type_repr={`bool`}
    default_repr={`True`}
>

Whether to include the third party requirements the binary depends on in the packaged PEX file.

</Field>

## `include_sources`

<Field
    type_repr={`bool`}
    default_repr={`True`}
>

Whether to include your first party sources the binary uses in the packaged PEX file.

</Field>

## `include_tools`

<Field
    type_repr={`bool`}
    default_repr={`False`}
>

Whether to include Pex tools in the PEX bootstrap code.

With tools included, the generated PEX file can be executed with `PEX_TOOLS=1 <pex file> --help` to gain access to all the available tools.

</Field>

## `inherit_path`

<Field
    type_repr={`'fallback' | 'false' | 'prefer' | None`}
    default_repr={`None`}
>

Whether to inherit the `sys.path` (aka PYTHONPATH) of the environment that the binary runs in.

Use `false` to not inherit `sys.path`; use `fallback` to inherit `sys.path` after packaged dependencies; and use `prefer` to inherit `sys.path` before packaged dependencies.

</Field>

## `interpreter_constraints`

<Field
    type_repr={`Iterable[str] | None`}
    default_repr={`None`}
>

The Python interpreters this code is compatible with.

Each element should be written in pip-style format, e.g. `CPython==2.7.*` or `CPython>=3.6,<4`. You can leave off `CPython` as a shorthand, e.g. `>=2.7` will be expanded to `CPython>=2.7`.

Specify more than one element to OR the constraints, e.g. `['PyPy==3.7.*', 'CPython==3.7.*']` means either PyPy 3.7 _or_ CPython 3.7.

If the field is not set, it will default to the option `[python].interpreter_constraints`.

See https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.31/docs/python/overview/interpreter-compatibility for how these interpreter constraints are merged with the constraints of dependencies.

</Field>

## `layout`

<Field
    type_repr={`'loose' | 'packed' | 'zipapp' | None`}
    default_repr={`'zipapp'`}
>

The layout used for the PEX binary.

By default, a PEX is created as a single file zipapp, but either a packed or loose directory tree based layout can be chosen instead.

A packed layout PEX is an executable directory structure designed to have cache-friendly characteristics for syncing incremental updates to PEXed applications over a network. At the top level of the packed directory tree there is an executable `__main__.py` script. The directory can also be executed by passing its path to a Python executable; e.g: `python packed-pex-dir/`. The Pex bootstrap code and all dependency code are packed into individual zip files for efficient caching and syncing.

A loose layout PEX is similar to a packed PEX, except that neither the Pex bootstrap code nor the dependency code are packed into zip files, but are instead present as collections of loose files in the directory tree providing different caching and syncing tradeoffs.

Both zipapp and packed layouts install themselves in the `$PEX_ROOT` as loose apps by default before executing, but these layouts compose with `execution_mode='zipapp'` as well.

</Field>

## `output_path`

<Field
    type_repr={`str | None`}
    default_repr={`'\${spec_path_normalized}/\${target_name_normalized}\${file_suffix}'`}
>

Where the built asset should be located.

This field supports the following template replacements:

- `${spec_path_normalized}`: The path to the target&#x27;s directory (&#x22;spec path&#x22;) with forward slashes replaced by dots.

- `${target_name_normalized}`: The target&#x27;s name with paramaterizations escaped by replacing dots with underscores.

- `${file_suffix}`: For target&#x27;s which produce single file artifacts, this is the file type suffix to use with a leading dot,
  and is empty otherwise when not applicable.

If undefined, this will use the path to the BUILD file, followed by the target name. For example, `src/python/project:app` would be `src.python.project/app.ext`. This behavior corresponds to the default template: `${spec_path_normalized}/${target_name_normalized}${file_suffix}`

When running `pants package`, this path will be prefixed by `--distdir` (e.g. `dist/`).

Warning: setting this value risks naming collisions with other package targets you may have.

</Field>

## `resolve`

<Field
    type_repr={`str | None`}
    default_repr={`None`}
>

The resolve from `[python].resolves` to use.

If not defined, will default to `[python].default_resolve`.

All dependencies must share the same value for their `resolve` field.

</Field>

## `restartable`

<Field
    type_repr={`bool`}
    default_repr={`False`}
>

If true, runs of this target with the `run` goal may be interrupted and restarted when its input files change.

</Field>

## `script`

<Field
    type_repr={`str | None`}
    default_repr={`None`}
>

Set the entry point, i.e. what gets run when executing `./my_app.pex`, to a script or console_script as defined by any of the distributions in the PEX.

You may only set one of: this field, or the `entry_point` field, or the `executable` field. Leave off all three fields to have no entry point.

</Field>

## `sh_boot`

<Field
    type_repr={`bool`}
    default_repr={`False`}
>

Should PEX create a modified ZIPAPP that uses `/bin/sh` to boot?

If you know the machines that the PEX will be distributed to have POSIX compliant `/bin/sh` (almost all do, see: https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/sh.html); then this is probably the way you want your PEX to boot. Instead of launching via a Python shebang, the PEX will launch via a `#!/bin/sh` shebang that executes a small script embedded in the head of the PEX ZIPAPP that performs initial interpreter selection and re-execution of the underlying PEX in a way that is often more robust than a Python shebang and always faster on 2nd and subsequent runs since the sh script has a constant overhead of O(1ms) whereas the Python overhead to perform the same interpreter selection and re-execution is O(100ms).

</Field>

## `shebang`

<Field
    type_repr={`str | None`}
    default_repr={`None`}
>

Set the generated PEX to use this shebang, rather than the default of PEX choosing a shebang based on the interpreter constraints.

This influences the behavior of running `./result.pex`. You can ignore the shebang by instead running `/path/to/python_interpreter ./result.pex`.

</Field>

## `strip_pex_env`

<Field
    type_repr={`bool`}
    default_repr={`True`}
>

Whether or not to strip the PEX runtime environment of `PEX*` environment variables.

Most applications have no need for the `PEX*` environment variables that are used to control PEX startup; so these variables are scrubbed from the environment by Pex before transferring control to the application by default. This prevents any subprocesses that happen to execute other PEX files from inheriting these control knob values since most would be undesired; e.g.: PEX_MODULE or PEX_PATH.

</Field>

## `tags`

<Field
    type_repr={`Iterable[str] | None`}
    default_repr={`None`}
>

Arbitrary strings to describe a target.

For example, you may tag some test targets with &#x27;integration_test&#x27; so that you could run `pants --tag='integration_test' test ::` to only run on targets with that tag.

</Field>

## `venv_hermetic_scripts`

<Field
    type_repr={`bool`}
    default_repr={`True`}
>

If execution_mode is &#x22;venv&#x22;, emit a hermetic venv `pex` script and hermetic console scripts.

The venv `pex` script and the venv console scripts are constructed to be hermetic by default; Python is executed with `-sE` to restrict the `sys.path` to the PEX venv contents only. Setting this field to `False` elides the Python `-sE` restrictions and can be used to interoperate with frameworks that use `PYTHONPATH` manipulation to run code.

</Field>

## `venv_site_packages_copies`

<Field
    type_repr={`bool`}
    default_repr={`False`}
>

If execution_mode is venv, populate the venv site packages using hard links or copies of resolved PEX dependencies instead of symlinks.

This can be used to work around problems with tools or libraries that are confused by symlinked source files.
