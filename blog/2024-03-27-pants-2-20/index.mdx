We are pleased to announce Pants 2.20.0, the latest release of [Pantsbuild, the scalable and ergonomic build system](https://www.pantsbuild.org/). To update, set `pants_version = "2.20.0"` in your `pants.toml`. If you're not using Pants yet, [get started now](https://www.pantsbuild.org/docs/getting-started).

_Highlights in 2.20 include_:

- ⚡ Support for the Ruff formatter, for both `BUILD` files and normal Python files.
- 🔒 Built-in support for [Terraform lockfiles](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.20/docs/terraform#lockfiles).
- 📁 Support for [more remote-caching providers](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.20/docs/using-pants/remote-caching-and-execution/remote-caching): file system and GitHub Actions Cache.
- 🪥 New helpers for [defining "adhoc" code-quality tools](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.20/reference/targets/code_quality_tool), without requiring a full plugin.
- ☕ JVM third-party artifacts [can now be read from `pom.xml` files](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.20/reference/targets/jvm_artifacts), and other related improvements.
- 🐿 Go 1.22 can now be used.
- 🥚 Several features of the [Pex](https://docs.pex-tool.org/) tool are now exposed by Pants including [`sh_boot`](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.20/reference/targets/pex_binary#sh_boot) [`executable`](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.20/reference/targets/pex_binary#executable), and [`check`](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.20/reference/targets/pex_binary#check).
- ⚠ Pex's [`emit_warnings`](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.20/reference/subsystems/pex#emit_warnings) now works as advertised and comes with a [global option](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.20/reference/subsystems/pex#emit_warnings).
- 🐋 Experimental support for [Podman](https://podman.io/) with `pants.backend.experimental.docker.podman`.
- 📈 And lots of smaller features, bugfixes, and general improvements
