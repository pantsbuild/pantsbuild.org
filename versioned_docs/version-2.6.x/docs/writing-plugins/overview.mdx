An intro to the Pants engine's core concepts.

---

Pants is designed for extensibility: you can extend Pants by writing custom _plugins_, using a standard Plugin API. In fact, all of Pants's built-in functionality uses the same API!

Some of the ways you can extend Pants:

- Add support for new languages.
- Add new goals, like a `publish` goal or `docker` goal.
- Add new linters, formatters, and type-checkers.
- Add new codegen implementations.
- Define new target types that still work with core Pants.
- Add new forms of dependency inference
- Define macros to reduce boilerplate in BUILD files.

Thanks to Pants's execution engine, your plugins will automatically bring you the same benefits you get from using core Pants, including:

- Fine-grained caching.
- Concurrent execution.
- Remote execution.

:::danger The Plugin API is not yet stable
While we'll try our best to limit changes, the Plugin API does not yet follow the [Deprecation Policy](../releases/deprecation-policy.mdx). Components of the API may change between minor versions—e.g. 2.1.0 to 2.2.0—without a deprecation.

We will document any changes in the release notes with a guide on how to navigate the change.

## Core concepts

The plugin API is split into two main interfaces:

1. [The Target API](./the-target-api/concepts.mdx): a declarative interface for creating new target types and extending pre-existing targets.
2. [The Rules API](./the-rules-api/concepts.mdx): where you define your logic and model each step of your build.

Plugins are written in typed Python 3 code. You write your logic in Python, and then Pants will run your plugin in the Rust engine.

## Locating Plugin code

Plugins can be consumed in either of two ways:

- From a published package in a repository such as [PyPI](https://pypi.org/).
- directly from in-repo sources.

It's often convenient to use in-repo plugins, when the plugin is only relevant to a single repo, and you want to iterate on it rapidly. In other cases, you may want to publish the plugin, so it can be reused across multiple repos.

### Published plugins

You consume published plugins by adding them to the `plugins` option:

```toml title="pants.toml"
[GLOBAL]
plugins = [
  "my.plugin==2.3.4",
]
```

### In-repo plugins

Conventionally, in-repo plugins live in a folder called `pants-plugins`, although they may be placed anywhere.

You must specify the path to your plugin's top-level folder using the `pythonpath` option:

```toml title="pants.toml"
[GLOBAL]
pythonpath = ["%(buildroot)s/pants-plugins"]
```

:::caution In-repo dependencies
In-repo plugin code should not depend on other in-repo code outside of the `pants-plugins` folder. The `pants-plugins` folder helps isolate plugins from regular code, which is necessary due to how Pants's startup sequence works.
:::

You can depend on third-party dependencies in your in-repo plugin by adding them to the `plugins` option:

```toml title="pants.toml"
[GLOBAL]
plugins = [
  "ansicolors==1.18.0",
]
```

## Enabling Plugins with `register.py`

Recall that a Pants [_backend_](../using-pants/key-concepts/backends.mdx) is a Python package that implements some required functionality, and uses hooks to register itself with Pants.

A plugin will contain one or more backends, with the hooks for each one defined in a file called `register.py`. To enable a custom plugin you add its backends to your `backend_packages` configuration:

```toml tab={"label":"pants.toml"}
[GLOBAL]
pythonpath = ["%(buildroot)s/pants-plugins"]
backend_packages.add = [
  # This will activate `pants-plugins/plugin1/register.py`.
  "plugin1",
  # This will activate `pants-plugins/subdir/plugin2/register.py`.
  "subdir.plugin2",
]
```

```python tab={"label":"pants-plugins/plugin1/register.py"}
from plugin1.lib import CustomTargetType, rule1, rule2


def rules():
    return [rule1, rule2]


def target_types():
    return [CustomTargetType]
```

## Building in-repo plugins with Pants

Because plugin code is written in Python, you can use Pants's [Python backend](../python/overview/enabling-python-support.mdx) to build your plugin code. For example, you can use Pants to lint, format, and test your plugin code.

To do so, set up Pants for [Python support](../python/overview/index.mdx), and add your `pants-plugins` directory as a source root:

```toml title="pants.toml"
[source]
root_patterns = [
  ..,
  "pants-plugins",
]
```

Your plugin code uses the Plugin API, so it depends on Pants's code as a 3rdparty dependency. It's important to depend on the exact Pants version that you're running in the repo.

One way to express this is to add `pantsbuild.pants==<version>` to your `requirements.txt`, but then you have to be careful to keep the versions in sync.

A better way is to use the `pants_requirement()` macro, which uses the `pants_version` from your `pants.toml`:

```python title="pants-plugins/BUILD"
pants_requirement(name="pants", dist="pantsbuild.pants")
```

Pants's [dependency inference](../using-pants/key-concepts/targets-and-build-files.mdx) understands imports of the `pants` module and will automatically add dependencies on the `pants_requirement` where relevant. You can also explicitly add it to the `dependencies` field:

```python title="pants-plugins/bash/BUILD"
python_library(
    # This will be inferred, but can also be explicitly specified.
    dependencies=["pants-plugins:pants"],
)
```

:::caution `pants_requirement` cannot update a constraints file
If you are using a lockfile—which we strongly recommend for both correctness and performance—then you will need to remember to regenerate your `constraints.txt` file when upgrading Pants versions.
