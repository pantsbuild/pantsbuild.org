How to configure which Python version(s) your project should use.

---

## Setting the default Python version

Configure your default Python interpreter compatibility constraints in `pants.toml` like this:

```toml title="pants.toml"
[python-setup]
interpreter_constraints = ["CPython==3.8.*"]
```

The value can be any valid Requirement-style string. For example:

- `CPython>=3.6`: CPython 3.6+
- `CPython>=2.7,!=3.0.*,!=3.1.*,!=3.2.*,!=3.3.*,!=3.4.*`: CPython 2.7 or 3.5+
- `CPython==3.7.3`: CPython 3.7.3
- `PyPy`: any version of PyPy

As a shortcut, you can leave off `CPython` and just put the version specifier. For example, `==3.8` will be expanded automatically to `CPython==3.8`.

## Using multiple Python versions in the same project

Pants also allows you to specify the interpreter compatibility for particular targets. This allows you to use multiple Python versions in the same repository, such as allowing you to incrementally migrate from Python 2 to Python 3.

Use the `compatibility` field on a Python target to override its interpreter constraints, like this:

```python title="BUILD"
python_library(
    name="python2_target",
    compatibility="==2.7.*",
)
```

If `compatibility` is left off, the target will default to the value from the option `interpreter_constraints` in `[python-setup]`.

Pants will merge the constraints from the target's _transitive closure_ when deciding which interpreter to use, meaning that it will look at the constraints of the target, its dependencies, and the dependencies of those dependencies. For example:

- Target A sets `compatibility==2.7.*`.
- Target B sets `compatibility>=3.5`, and it depends on Target A.
- When running `./pants binary :b`, Pants will merge the constraints to `==2.7.*,>=3.5`. This is impossible to satisfy, so Pants will error.

This means that every dependency of a target must also be compatible with its interpreter constraints. Generally, you will want to be careful that `python_library` targets are compatible with multiple Python versions because they may be depended upon by other targets. Meanwhile, `pex_binary` and `python_tests` targets can have specific constraints because they are (conventionally) never dependencies for other targets. For example:

```python
python_library(
   name="lib",
    # Library is compatible with Python 2.7 or 3.5+.
    compatibility=">=2.7,!=3.0.*,!=3.1.*,!=3.2.*,!=3.3.*,!=3.4.*",
)

pex_binary(
   dependences=[":lib"],
   entry_point="project.app:main",
   # When merged with the library's constraints, the final result will require `>=3.5`.
   compatibility=">=3.5",
)
```

:::caution Pants cannot validate that your interpreter constraints are accurate
Pants accepts your interpreter constraints at face value. If you use a constraint like `'>=3.6'`, Pants will trust you that your code indeed works with any interpreter >= 3.6, as Pants has no way to audit if your code is actually compatible.

Instead, consider running your unit tests with every Python version you claim to support to ensure that your code really is compatible:

```
python_tests(
   name="util_test_py2",
   sources=["util_test.py"],
   compatibility="==2.7.*",
)

python_tests(
   name="util_test_py36",
   sources=["util_test.py"],
   compatibility="==3.6.*",
)
```

This quickly gets tedious to write in BUILD files, so we recommend [defining a macro](../../writing-plugins/macros.mdx) that will generate all the targets for you.

:::tip Upcoming feature: `py-constraints` goal
Pants 2.1 adds the `pants.backend.python.mixed_interpreter_constraints` goal, which activates the `py-constraints` goal to show what final, merged constraints are used by a particular file or target and why.

You can also use `./pnats py-constraints --summary` to generate a CSV of every file and target's constraints, transitive constraints, and the # of dependencies (how easy it is to change) and # of dependees (how impactful it is to change). This is useful when migrating a codebase, such as Python 2 to 3 migrations.

:::note Tips for Python 2 -> Python 3 migrations
While every project will have different needs and scope, there are a few best practices with Pants that will allow for a more successful migration.

- Start by setting the `interpreter_constraints` option in `[python-setup]` to describe the status of the majority of your targets. If most are only compatible with Python 2, set it to `==2.7.*`. If most are compatible with Python 2 _and_ Python 3, set to `>=2.7,!=3.0.*,!=3.1.*,!=3.2.*,!=3.3.*,!=3.4.*`. If most are only compatible with Python 3, set to `>=3.5`. For any targets that don't match these global constraints, override with the `compatibility` field.
- Find your most-used targets, such as your util targets, by running `./pants dependees --transitive --output-format=json` (see [Project introspection](../../using-pants/project-introspection.mdx)). Focus on getting these targets to be compatible with Python 2 and 3. You may want to also run `./pants dependencies` on these targets to find which are the easiest to migrate.
- Once >40% of your targets work with both Python 2 and Python 3, change the `interpreter_constraints` option in `[python-setup]` to specify compatibility with both Python 2.7 and Python 3 so that all new code uses this by default.
- For targets at the "top" of the graph, meaning targets which have no or few dependencies, change them to Python 3-only when possible so that you can start using all the neat new Python 3 features like f-strings! You can usually do this to `python_tests` and `pex_binary` targets, as they are never dependencies for other targets. You can also do this if every "dependee" target also works exclusively with Python 3. Use `./pants dependees --transitive path/to:target` to see what depends on the target.

## Changing the interpreter search path

Pants will default to looking at your `$PATH` to discover Python interpreters. You can change this by setting the option `interpreter_search_paths` in the `[python-setup]` scope.

You can specify absolute paths to interpreter binaries and/or to directories containing interpreter binaries. In addition, Pants understands some special symbols:

- `<PATH>`: read the `$PATH` env var
- `<PYENV>`: use all directories in `$(pyenv root)/versions`
- `<PYENV_LOCAL>`: the interpreter specified in the local file `.python-version`

For example:

```toml title="pants.toml"
[python-setup]
interpreter_search_paths = ["<PYENV>", "/opt/python3"]
```
