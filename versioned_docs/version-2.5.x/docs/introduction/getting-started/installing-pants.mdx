## Prerequisites

To run Pants, you need:

- Linux (x86_64) or macOS (either Intel or Apple Silicon, 10.15 Catalina or newer).
- Python 3.7, 3.8, or 3.9 discoverable on your `PATH`.
- Internet access (so that Pants can fully bootstrap itself).

:::caution Some Linux distributions may need additional packages
On Ubuntu you may need to run:
`apt install -y python3-dev python3-distutils`.
:::

:::note Apple Silicon (M1) support
We publish a macOS `arm64` wheel for Python 3.9. Make sure you have Python 3.9 discoverable on your `$PATH`, e.g. via Homebrew or Pyenv, and an updated version of the `./pants` runner script.

Given the lack of CI infrastructure for Apple Silicon, this support is best-effort and there may a delay in publishing this wheel compared to our normal releases.

If you have Python code, you may need to [set your interpreter constraints](../../python/overview/interpreter-compatibility.mdx) to Python 3.9+, as many tools like Black will not install correctly when using earlier Python versions.

Some users have also had success with earlier versions using Rosetta by running `arch -x86_64 pants`. Note that Pants's cache currently does not work properly when switching between architectures; you will need to run `rm -rf ~/.cache/pants` when switching.
:::

:::caution Alpine Linux is not yet supported
Pants for Linux is currently distributed as a manylinux wheel. Alpine Linux is not covered by manylinux (it uses MUSL libc while manylinux requires glibc), so at present Pants will not run on Alpine Linux.

If you need to run Pants on Alpine, [let us know](/community/members), so we can prioritize this work. Meanwhile, you can try [building Pants yourself](#building-pants-from-sources) on Alpine.
:::

:::caution Linux on ARM is not yet supported
Pants for Linux is currently only distributed as an x86_64 wheel.

If you need to run Pants on ARM, please [comment on this issue](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/issues/12183) so we can prioritize this work. Meanwhile, you can try [building Pants yourself](#building-pants-from-sources) on ARM.
:::

:::note Python 2 compatibility
Pants requires Python 3.7+ to run itself, but it can build Python 2 code (and earlier Python versions like 3.6).
:::

:::note Using a proxy?
See [Proxies](../../using-pants/troubleshooting-common-issues/proxies.mdx) for instructions.

## Creating the launch script

Pants is invoked via a launch script named `./pants` , saved at the root of the repository. This script will install Pants and handle upgrades.

First, set up a minimal `pants.toml` config file to instruct the script to download the latest 2.5 release:

```bash
printf '[GLOBAL]\npants_version = "2.5.2"\n' > pants.toml
```

Then, download the script:

```bash
curl -L -o ./pants https://pantsbuild.github.io/setup/pants && \
chmod +x ./pants
```

Now, run this to bootstrap Pants and to verify the version it installs:

```bash
./pants --version
```

:::note Tip: add `./pants` to version control
This will allow all users in the project to use Pants without having to install it themselves.

### Building Pants from sources

We currently distribute Pants for Linux (x86_64) and macOS.

If you need to run Pants on some other platform, such as Linux on ARM or Alpine Linux, you can try building it yourself by checking out the [Pants repo](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants), and running `./pants package src/python/pants:pants-packaged` to build a wheel.
