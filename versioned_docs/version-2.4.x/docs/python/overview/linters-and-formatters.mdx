How to activate and use the Python linters and formatters bundled with Pants.

## Activating linters and formatters

Linter/formatter support is implemented in separate [backends](../../using-pants/concepts/backends.mdx) so that they are easy to opt in to individually:
| Backend | Tool |
| :--- | :--- |
| `pants.backend.python.lint.bandit` | [Bandit](https://bandit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/): security linter |
| `pants.backend.python.lint.black` | [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/): code formatter |
| `pants.backend.python.lint.docformatter` | [Docformatter](https://pypi.org/project/docformatter/): docstring formatter |
| `pants.backend.python.lint.flake8` | [Flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/): style and bug linter |
| `pants.backend.python.lint.isort` | [isort](https://readthedocs.org/projects/isort/): import statement formatter |
| `pants.backend.python.lint.pylint` | [Pylint](https://www.pylint.org/): style and bug linter |

To enable, add the appropriate backends in `pants.toml`:

```toml title="pants.toml"
[GLOBAL]
...
backend_packages = [
  'pants.backend.python',
  'pants.backend.python.lint.black',
  'pants.backend.python.lint.isort',
]
```

You should now be able to run `./pants lint`, and possibly `./pants fmt`:

```
$ ./pants lint src/py/project.py
17:54:32.51 [INFO] Completed: lint - Flake8 succeeded.
17:54:32.70 [INFO] Completed: lint - Black succeeded.
All done! ‚ú® üç∞ ‚ú®
1 file would be left unchanged.

17:54:33.91 [INFO] Completed: lint - isort succeeded.

‚úì Black succeeded.
‚úì Flake8 succeeded.
‚úì isort succeeded.
```

:::note How to activate MyPy
MyPy is run with the [typecheck goal](../goals/typecheck.mdx), rather than `lint`.

## Configuring the tools and adding plugins

Each formatter and linter allows you to configure

- `--version`: the version to use.
- `--config`: the config file location (relative to the build root).
- `--args`: any command-line arguments you want to pass to the tool.
- `--extra-requirements`: any additional libraries to install, such as any plugins.

For example:

```toml title="pants.toml"
[black]
config = "pyproject.toml"

[docformatter]
args = ["--wrap-summaries=100", "--wrap-descriptions=100"]

[flake8]
config = "build-support/.flake8"
version = "flake8==3.8.0"
# Add a Flake8 plugin:
extra_requirements.add = ["flake8-2020"]
```

Run `./pants help-advanced black`, `./pants help-advanced flake8`, and so on for more information.

:::caution Config files must be explicitly declared before Pants 2.5+
Many tools will automatically discover their config files if it's at a standard location, like isort looking for the file `.isort.cfg`. This auto-discovery does not work with Pants; you must explicitly set the `--config` option for Pants to use the correct config file.

This was fixed in Pants 2.5.
:::

:::note How to use first-party Pylint plugins
Pants supports custom Pylint plugins written by you. Run `./pants help-advanced pylint` for instructions with the `--pylint-source-plugins` option.

If you want to write first-party plugins for other linters like Flake8, let us know on [Slack](/community/members).

## Temporarily skipping a formatter or linter

Use the `--skip` option. For example, run:

```bash
$ ./pants --black-skip --flake8-skip fmt ::
```

## Tip: only run over changed files

With formatters and linters, there is usually no need to rerun on files that have not changed.

Use the option `--changed-since` to get much better performance, like this:

```bash
$ ./pants --changed-since=HEAD fmt
```

or

```bash
$ ./pants --changed-since=main lint
```

Pants will find which files have changed and only run over those files. See [Advanced target selection](../../using-pants/advanced-target-selection.mdx) for more information.
