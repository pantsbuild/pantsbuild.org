## `tags`

<Field
    type_repr={`field.type_hint`}
>

Arbitrary strings to describe a target.

For example, you may tag some test targets with &#x27;integration_test&#x27; so that you could run `./pants --tag='integration_test' test ::` to only run on targets with that tag.

</Field>

## `description`

<Field
    type_repr={`field.type_hint`}
>

A human-readable description of the target.

Use `./pants list --documented ::` to see all targets with descriptions.

</Field>

## `dependencies`

<Field
    type_repr={`field.type_hint`}
>

Addresses to other targets that this target depends on, e.g. [&#x27;helloworld/subdir:lib&#x27;].

Alternatively, you may include file names. Pants will find which target owns that file, and create a new target from that which only includes the file in its `sources` field. For files relative to the current BUILD file, prefix with `./`; otherwise, put the full path, e.g. [&#x27;./sibling.txt&#x27;, &#x27;resources/demo.json&#x27;].

You may exclude dependencies by prefixing with `!`, e.g. `['!helloworld/subdir:lib', '!./sibling.txt']`. Ignores are intended for false positives with dependency inference; otherwise, simply leave off the dependency from the BUILD file.

</Field>

## `provides`

<Field
    type_repr={`field.type_hint`}
>

The setup.py kwargs for the external artifact built from this target.

You must define `name`. You can also set almost any keyword argument accepted by setup.py in the `setup()` function: (https://packaging.python.org/guides/distributing-packages-using-setuptools/#setup-args).

See https://www.pantsbuild.org/v2.6/docs/plugins-setup-py for how to write a plugin to dynamically generate kwargs.

</Field>

## `setup_py_commands`

<Field
    type_repr={`field.type_hint`}
>

The runtime commands to invoke setup.py with to create the distribution, e.g. [&quot;bdist_wheel&quot;, &quot;--python-tag=py36.py37&quot;, &quot;sdist&quot;].

If empty or unspecified, will just create a chroot with a setup() function.
