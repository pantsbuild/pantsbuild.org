We are pleased to announce Pants [2.28.0](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/blob/2.28.x/docs/notes/2.28.x.md), the latest release of [Pantsbuild, the scalable and ergonomic build system](https://www.pantsbuild.org/). To update, set `pants_version = "2.28.0"` in your `pants.toml`. If you're not using Pants yet, [get started now](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.28/docs/getting-started).

Thank you to [Klaviyo](https://www.klaviyo.com/) for their Platinum tier [sponsorship](https://www.pantsbuild.org/sponsors) throughout this release!

## Highlights in [2.28](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/blob/2.28.x/docs/notes/2.28.x.md) include:

- üöÄ **Significantly faster daemon startup** - Some real-world codebases report startup time cut to 30-40% of what it was in v2.27.0 (2.5-3√ó faster!).
- üéØ **TypeScript improvements** - TypeScript targets now work with JavaScript goals, plus better dependency inference with TSX grammar.
- üì¶ **Batch remote reads** - Experimental support for batch reads from the gRPC Remote Execution API significantly increases throughput.
- üêç **Direct type stub generation** - Protobuf can now generate Python type stubs directly via `protoc`.
- üêû And a whole bunch of updates, bugfixes, and general improvements!
