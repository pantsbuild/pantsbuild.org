Alternative techniques to tell Pants which files/targets to run on.

---

See [File arguments vs. target arguments](./key-concepts/goals.mdx#file-arguments-vs-target-arguments) for the normal techniques for telling Pants what to run on.

See [Project introspection](./project-introspection.mdx) for queries that you can run and then pipe into another Pants run, such as running over certain target types.

## Running over changed files with `--changed-since`

Because Pants understands Git, it can find which files have changed since a certain commit through the `--changed-since` option.

For example, to lint all uncommitted files, run:

```bash
./pants --changed-since=HEAD lint
```

To run against another branch, run:

```bash
./pants --changed-since=origin/main lint
```

By default, `--changed-since` will only run over files directly changed. Often, though, you will want to run over any [dependees](./project-introspection.mdx) of those changed files, meaning any targets that depend on the changed files. Use ` --changed-dependees=direct` or ` --changed-dependees=transitive` for this:

```bash
$ ./pants \
  --changed-since=origin/main \
  --changed-dependees=transitive \
  test
```

## Tags: annotating targets

Every target type has a field called `tags`, which allows you to add a sequence of strings. The strings can be whatever you'd like, such as `"integration_test"` or `"skip_lint"`.

```python title="BUILD"
python_tests(
    name="integration",
    sources=["*_integration_test.py"],
    tags=["skip_lint", "integration_test"],
)
```

You can then filter by tags with the global `--tags` option, like this:

```bash
./pants --tag=integration_test list ::
```

To exclude certain tags, prefix with a `-`:

```bash
./pants --tag='-integration_test' list ::
```

You can even combine multiple includes and excludes:

```bash
./pants --tag='+type_checked,skip_lint' --tags='-integration_test' list ::
```

## `--spec-files`

The global option `--spec-files` allows you to pass a file containing target addresses and/or file names/globs to Pants.

Each entry must be separated by a new line.

For example:

```text tab={"label":"Shell"}
$ ./pants --spec-files=targets.txt list
```

```text tab={"label":"targets.txt"}
helloworld/lang/*.py
helloworld/util
helloworld/util:tests
```

:::note Tip: centralized allow/block lists
Whereas `tags` are useful for _decentralized_ allow/block lists, `--spec-files` is useful when you want to define one single list of targets or files.

## Piping to other Pants runs

To pipe a Pants run, use your shell's `|` pipe operator and `xargs`:

```bash
./pants dependees helloworld/util | xargs ./pants  list
```

You can, of course, pipe multiple times:

```bash
$ ./pants dependees helloworld/util | \
   xargs ./pants  list | \
   xargs ./pants lint
```

:::note Alternative: use `--spec-files`
Sometimes, you may want to reuse the output of a Pants run for multiple subsequent Pants runs. Rather than repeating `xargs` multiple times, you can generate a file through stdout redirection and `--spec-files`.

For example:

```bash
$ ./pants dependencies helloworld/util > util_dependencies.txt
$ ./pants --spec-files=util_dependencies.txt lint
```

If you don't want to save the output to an actual file—such as to not pollute version control—you can use a variable and a named pipe:

```bash
$ TARGETS=$(./pants dependencies helloworld/util)
$ ./pants --spec-files=<(echo $TARGETS) lint
```
