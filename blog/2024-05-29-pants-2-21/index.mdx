We are pleased to announce Pants [2.21.0](<(https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/tree/2.21.x/src/python/pants/notes/2.21.x.md)>), the latest release of [Pantsbuild, the scalable and ergonomic build system](https://www.pantsbuild.org/). To update, set `pants_version = "2.21.0"` in your `pants.toml`. If you're not using Pants yet, [get started now](https://www.pantsbuild.org/docs/getting-started).

_Highlights in [2.21](<(https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/tree/2.21.x/src/python/pants/notes/2.21.x.md)>) include_:

- üß™ All backends now support [`[test].attempts_default`](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.21/reference/goals/test#attempts_default)
- ‚ö° Pants internal manipulation of Python dependencies by way of [Pex](https://docs.pex-tool.org/) is now [substantially faster](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/blob/2.21.x/src/python/pants/notes/2.21.x.md#python) in many cases.
- üìú The [`__defaults__`](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.21/docs/using-pants/key-concepts/targets-and-build-files#field-default-values) symbol will now set default values for generated targets too. For instance, `__defaults__({python_source: dict(skip_black=True)})` will now apply to the `python_source` targets generated by a python_sources target, without having to write `__defaults__({(python_source, python_sources): ...})`
- ‚ôª When running in CI, Pants will output a command to [rerun only the failed tests](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.21/reference/goals/test#show_rerun_command).
- üêç All built in lockfiles are now Python 3.12 ready.
- üö° As part of regenerating lockfiles for Python 3.12, the default version of most builtin Python tools has been updated.
- üê≥ The [`cache_from` field](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.21/reference/targets/docker_image#cache_from) on `docker_image` now supports multiple values.
- üèú The `experimental-deploy` goal now has built-in support for the [`--dry-run` option](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.21/reference/goals/experimental-deploy#dry_run).
- ü™ú Scalafix can now be run by Pants using the [new `pants.backend.experimental.scala.lint.scalafix` backend](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.21/docs/jvm/java-and-scala#fix-scala-code).
- üìà And lots of smaller features, update, bugfixes, and general improvements
