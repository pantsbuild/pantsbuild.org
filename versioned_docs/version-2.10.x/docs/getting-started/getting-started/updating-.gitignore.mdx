Ignoring Pants's byproduct files.

---

If you use Git, we recommend adding these lines to your top-level `.gitignore` file:

```text title=".gitignore"
# Pants workspace files
/.pants.d/
/dist/
/.pids
/.pants.workdir.file_lock*
/.pants.rc
```

:::note FYI: your `.gitignore` is used to auto-populate the option `pants_ignore`
The `pants_ignore` option tells Pants which files to avoid looking at. Occasionally, you will want to ignore something with Git, but still want Pants to work on the file. See [Troubleshooting / common issues](../../using-pants/troubleshooting-common-issues.mdx) for how to do this.
