Some highlights:

- Improved performance when running Python subprocesses like Pytest, Flake8, and MyPy, thanks to Pex's new `venv` mode. This shaved off around 1 second for test runs in benchmarks!
- `./pants tailor` goal, which will auto-generate BUILD files for you. See [Adopting Pants in existing repositories](../../using-pants/adopting-pants-in-existing-repos.mdx).
- Support for specifying `file://` URLs [for downloaded tools](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/pull/11499) like Pex and Protoc.
- More robust remote caching support. The client should be more stable and should avoid performance slowdowns thanks to some new optimizations. See [Remote Execution](../../using-pants/remote-caching-&-execution/remote-execution.mdx).
