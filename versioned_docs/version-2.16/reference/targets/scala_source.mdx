## `tags`

<Field
    type_repr={`field.type_hint`}
>

Arbitrary strings to describe a target.

For example, you may tag some test targets with &#x27;integration_test&#x27; so that you could run `scie-pants-linux-x86_64 --tag='integration_test' test ::` to only run on targets with that tag.

</Field>

## `description`

<Field
    type_repr={`field.type_hint`}
>

A human-readable description of the target.

Use `scie-pants-linux-x86_64 list --documented ::` to see all targets with descriptions.

</Field>

## `dependencies`

<Field
    type_repr={`field.type_hint`}
>

Addresses to other targets that this target depends on, e.g. [&#x27;helloworld/subdir:lib&#x27;, &#x27;helloworld/main.py:lib&#x27;, &#x27;3rdparty:reqs#django&#x27;].

This augments any dependencies inferred by Pants, such as by analyzing your imports. Use `scie-pants-linux-x86_64 dependencies` or `scie-pants-linux-x86_64 peek` on this target to get the final result.

See https://www.pantsbuild.org/v2.16/docs/targets for more about how addresses are formed, including for generated targets. You can also run `scie-pants-linux-x86_64 list ::` to find all addresses in your project, or `scie-pants-linux-x86_64 list dir` to find all addresses defined in that directory.

If the target is in the same BUILD file, you can leave off the BUILD file path, e.g. `:tgt` instead of `helloworld/subdir:tgt`. For generated first-party addresses, use `./` for the file path, e.g. `./main.py:tgt`; for all other generated targets, use `:tgt#generated_name`.

You may exclude dependencies by prefixing with `!`, e.g. `['!helloworld/subdir:lib', '!./sibling.txt']`. Ignores are intended for false positives with dependency inference; otherwise, simply leave off the dependency from the BUILD file.

</Field>

## `source`

<Field
    type_repr={`field.type_hint`}
>

A single file that belongs to this target.

Path is relative to the BUILD file&#x27;s directory, e.g. `source='example.ext'`.

</Field>

## `scalac_plugins`

<Field
    type_repr={`field.type_hint`}
>

The names of Scala plugins that this source file requires.

The plugin must be defined by a corresponding `scalac_plugin` AND `jvm_artifact` target, and must be present in this target&#x27;s resolve&#x27;s lockfile.

If not specified, this will default to the plugins specified in `[scalac].plugins_for_resolve` for this target&#x27;s resolve.

</Field>

## `resolve`

<Field
    type_repr={`field.type_hint`}
>

The resolve from `[jvm].resolves` to use when compiling this target.

If not defined, will default to `[jvm].default_resolve`.

</Field>

## `experimental_provides_types`

<Field
    type_repr={`field.type_hint`}
>

Signals that the specified types should be fulfilled by these source files during dependency inference.

This allows for specific types within packages that are otherwise inferred as belonging to `jvm_artifact` targets to be unambiguously inferred as belonging to this first-party source.

If a given type is defined, at least one source file captured by this target must actually provide that symbol.

</Field>

## `jdk`

<Field
    type_repr={`field.type_hint`}
>

The major version of the JDK that this target should be built with. If not defined, will default to `[jvm].default_source_jdk`.

</Field>

## `main`

<Field
    type_repr={`field.type_hint`}
>

`.`-separated name of the JVM class containing the `main()` method to be called when executing this target. If not supplied, this will be calculated automatically, either by inspecting the existing manifest (for 3rd-party JARs), or by inspecting the classes inside the JAR, looking for a valid `main` method. If a value cannot be calculated automatically, you must supply a value for `run` to succeed.

</Field>

## `skip_scalafmt`

<Field
    type_repr={`field.type_hint`}
    default_repr={`False`}
    backend="pants.backend.experimental.scala.lint.scalafmt"
>

If true, don&#x27;t run `scalafmt` on this target&#x27;s code.

</Field>
