Some highlights:

- The `run`, `test`, and `setup-py` goals support passing arguments via `--`, e.g. `./pants test test_app.py -- -vv -k test_demo`.
- Python linters can now run on both Python 2 and Python 3 targets in the same run. See [lint](../../python/goals/lint.mdx).
- Added support for Pylint source plugins. See [Linters and formatters](../../python/overview/linters-and-formatters.mdx).
- Added the `filter` goal. See [Project introspection](../../using-pants/project-introspection.mdx).
- Code generators will now automatically add the generator's runtime dependencies. See [Protobuf](../../codegen/protobuf-and-grpc.mdx).
- Resolving requirements should be a bit faster thanks to better caching.
- Improved the Pants daemon (pantsd). It should now be safe to turn on with the option `enable_pantsd = true` in the `[GLOBAL]` scope. Pantsd substantially improves Pants performance and caching.
- Removed deprecated `source` field in BUILD files in favor of `sources`.
- Removed several deprecated V1 backends and plugins.
