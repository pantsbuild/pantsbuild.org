## `tags`

<Field
    type_repr={`field.type_hint`}
>

Arbitrary strings to describe a target.

For example, you may tag some test targets with &#x27;integration_test&#x27; so that you could run `scie-pants-linux-x86_64 --tag='integration_test' test ::` to only run on targets with that tag.

</Field>

## `description`

<Field
    type_repr={`field.type_hint`}
>

A human-readable description of the target.

Use `scie-pants-linux-x86_64 list --documented ::` to see all targets with descriptions.

</Field>

## `output_path`

<Field
    type_repr={`field.type_hint`}
>

Where the built asset should be located.

If undefined, this will use the path to the BUILD file, followed by the target name. For example, `src/python/project:app` would be `src.python.project/app.ext`.

When running `scie-pants-linux-x86_64 package`, this path will be prefixed by `--distdir` (e.g. `dist/`).

Warning: setting this value risks naming collisions with other package targets you may have.

</Field>

## `dependencies`

<Field
    type_repr={`field.type_hint`}
>

Addresses to other targets that this target depends on, e.g. `['helloworld/subdir:lib', 'helloworld/main.py:lib', '3rdparty:reqs#django']`.

This augments any dependencies inferred by Pants, such as by analyzing your imports. Use `scie-pants-linux-x86_64 dependencies` or `scie-pants-linux-x86_64 peek` on this target to get the final result.

See https://www.pantsbuild.org/v2.17/docs/targets for more about how addresses are formed, including for generated targets. You can also run `scie-pants-linux-x86_64 list ::` to find all addresses in your project, or `scie-pants-linux-x86_64 list dir` to find all addresses defined in that directory.

If the target is in the same BUILD file, you can leave off the BUILD file path, e.g. `:tgt` instead of `helloworld/subdir:tgt`. For generated first-party addresses, use `./` for the file path, e.g. `./main.py:tgt`; for all other generated targets, use `:tgt#generated_name`.

You may exclude dependencies by prefixing with `!`, e.g. `['!helloworld/subdir:lib', '!./sibling.txt']`. Ignores are intended for false positives with dependency inference; otherwise, simply leave off the dependency from the BUILD file.

</Field>

## `handler`

<Field
    type_repr={`field.type_hint`}
>

Entry point to the AWS Lambda handler.

You can specify a full module like `'path.to.module:handler_func'` or use a shorthand to specify a file name, using the same syntax as the `sources` field, e.g. `'cloud_function.py:handler_func'`.

You must use the file name shorthand for file arguments to work with this target.

This is re-exported at `lambda_function.handler` in the resulting package to be used as the configured handler of the Lambda in AWS. It can also be accessed under its source-root-relative module path, for example: `path.to.module.handler_func`.

</Field>

## `include_requirements`

<Field
    type_repr={`field.type_hint`}
    default_repr={`True`}
>

Whether to resolve requirements and include them in the Pex. This is most useful with Lambda Layers to make code uploads smaller when deps are in layers. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-layers.html

</Field>

## `runtime`

<Field
    type_repr={`field.type_hint`}
>

The identifier of the AWS Lambda runtime to target (pythonX.Y). See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-python.html.

In general you&#x27;ll want to define either a `runtime` or one `complete_platforms` but not both. Specifying a `runtime` is simpler, but less accurate. If you have issues either packaging the AWS Lambda PEX or running it as a deployed AWS Lambda function, you should try using `complete_platforms` instead.

</Field>

## `complete_platforms`

<Field
    type_repr={`field.type_hint`}
>

The platforms the built PEX should be compatible with.

There must be built wheels available for all of the foreign platforms, rather than sdists.

You can give a list of multiple complete platforms to create a multiplatform PEX, meaning that the PEX will be executable in all of the supported environments.

Complete platforms should be addresses of `file` targets that point to files that contain complete platform JSON as described by Pex (https://pex.readthedocs.io/en/latest/buildingpex.html#complete-platform).

N.B.: If specifying `complete_platforms` to work around packaging failures encountered when using the `runtime` field, ensure you delete the `runtime` field from the target.

</Field>

## `resolve`

<Field
    type_repr={`field.type_hint`}
>

The resolve from `[python].resolves` to use.

If not defined, will default to `[python].default_resolve`.

All dependencies must share the same value for their `resolve` field.

</Field>

## `environment`

<Field
    type_repr={`field.type_hint`}
    default_repr={`'__local__'`}
>

Specify which environment target to consume environment-sensitive options from.

Once environments are defined in `[environments-preview].names`, you can specify the environment for this target by its name. Any fields that are defined in that environment will override the values from options set by `pants.toml`, command line values, or environment variables.

You can specify multiple valid environments by using `parametrize`. If `__local__` is specified, Pants will fall back to the `local_environment` defined for the current platform, or no environment if no such environment exists.
