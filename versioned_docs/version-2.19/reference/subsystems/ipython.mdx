## Basic options

## Advanced options

### `install_from_resolve`

<Option
  cli_repr={`--ipython-install-from-resolve=<str>`}
  env_repr='PANTS_IPYTHON_INSTALL_FROM_RESOLVE'
  default_repr={`None`}
>

If specified, install the tool using the lockfile for this named resolve.

This resolve must be defined in `[python].resolves`, as described in https://www.pantsbuild.org/v2.19/docs/python-third-party-dependencies#user-lockfiles.

The resolve&#x27;s entire lockfile will be installed, unless specific requirements are listed via the `requirements` option, in which case only those requirements will be installed. This is useful if you don&#x27;t want to invalidate the tool&#x27;s outputs when the resolve incurs changes to unrelated requirements.

If unspecified, and the `lockfile` option is unset, the tool will be installed using the default lockfile shipped with Pants.

If unspecified, and the `lockfile` option is set, the tool will use the custom `ipython` &quot;tool lockfile&quot; generated from the `version` and `extra_requirements` options. But note that this mechanism is deprecated.

</Option>

### `requirements`

<Option
  cli_repr={`--ipython-requirements="['<str>', '<str>', ...]"`}
  env_repr='PANTS_IPYTHON_REQUIREMENTS'
  default_repr={`[]`}
>

If `install_from_resolve` is specified, install these requirements, at the versions provided by the specified resolve&#x27;s lockfile.

Values can be pip-style requirements (e.g., `tool` or `tool==1.2.3` or `tool>=1.2.3`), or addresses of `python_requirement` targets (or targets that generate or depend on `python_requirement` targets).

The lockfile will be validated against the requirements - if a lockfile doesn&#x27;t provide the requirement (at a suitable version, if the requirement specifies version constraints) Pants will error.

If unspecified, install the entire lockfile.

</Option>

### `console_script`

<Option
  cli_repr={`--ipython-console-script=<str>`}
  env_repr='PANTS_IPYTHON_CONSOLE_SCRIPT'
  default_repr={`ipython`}
>

The console script for the tool. Using this option is generally preferable to (and mutually exclusive with) specifying an `--entry-point` since console script names have a higher expectation of staying stable across releases of the tool. Usually, you will not want to change this from the default.

</Option>

### `entry_point`

<Option
  cli_repr={`--ipython-entry-point=<str>`}
  env_repr='PANTS_IPYTHON_ENTRY_POINT'
  default_repr={`None`}
>

The entry point for the tool. Generally you only want to use this option if the tool does not offer a `--console-script` (which this option is mutually exclusive with). Usually, you will not want to change this from the default.

</Option>

### `ignore_cwd`

<Option
  cli_repr={`--[no-]ipython-ignore-cwd`}
  env_repr='PANTS_IPYTHON_IGNORE_CWD'
  default_repr={`True`}
>

Whether to tell IPython not to put the CWD on the import path.

Normally you want this to be True, so that imports come from the hermetic environment Pants creates.

However IPython&lt;7.13.0 doesn&#x27;t support this option, so if you&#x27;re using an earlier version (e.g., because you have Python 2.7 code) then you will need to set this to False, and you may have issues with imports from your CWD shading the hermetic environment.

</Option>
