How to create a Field, including the available templates.

---

Before creating a new target type, the first step is to create all of the target type's fields.

## Defining a Field

To define a new field:

1. Subclass one of the below field templates, like `IntField` or `BoolField`; or, subclass a pre-existing field, like `Sources`.
2. Define the class property `alias`. This is the symbol that people use in BUILD files.

For example:

```python
from pants.engine.target import IntField

class TimeoutField(IntField):
    """How long to run until timing out."""

    alias = "timeout"
```

### Changing the `default`

The `default` is used whenever a user does not explicitly specify the field in a BUILD file.

Set the class property `default = $val`, where `$val` is the value you want.

If you don't override this property, `default` will be set to `None`, which signals that the value was undefined.

### Marking a field as `required`

Set the class property `required = True` to enforce that users must explicitly define the field.

If you set `required = True`, the `default` value will be ignored.

### FYI: Pants uses the Docstring to generate docs

When you run `./pants help my_target`, Pants will use your field definition to generate the output. It will look at the class's docstring, the field template used, and whether `required = True`.

:::note Reminder: subclass pre-existing fields to modify their behavior
If you want to change how a pre-existing field behaves, you should subclass the original field. For example, if you want to change a default value, subclass the original field.

See [Concepts](./concepts.mdx) for how subclassing plays a key role in the Target API.

## Adding custom validation

The field templates will validate that users are using the correct _types_, like ints or strings. But you may want to add additional validation, such as banning certain values.

To do this, override the classmethod `compute_value`:

```python
from pants.engine.target import IntField, InvalidFieldException

class UploadTimeout(IntField):
    ...

    @classmethod
    def compute_value(
        cls, raw_value: Optional[int], *, address: Address
    ) -> int:
      value_or_default = super().compute_value(raw_value, address=address)
      if value_or_default < 10 or value_or_default > 300:
          raise InvalidFieldException(
              f"The {repr(cls.alias)} field in target {address} must "
              f"be between 10 and 300, but was {value_or_default}."
          )
      return value_or_default
```

Be careful to use the same type hint for the parameter `raw_value` as used in the template. This is used to generate the documentation in `./pants help my_target`.

## Available templates

All templates are defined in `pants.engine.target`.

### `BoolField`

Use this when the option is a boolean toggle.

If you do not set `required = True` or give a default, the default will be `None`. This can be useful to represent three states: unspecified, `False`, and `True`.

### `IntField`

Use this when you expect an integer. This will reject floats.

### `FloatField`

Use this when you expect a float. This will reject integers.

### `StringField`

Use this when you expect a single string.

:::note `StringField` can be like an enum
You can set the class property `valid_choices` to limit what strings are acceptable. This class property can either be a tuple of strings or an `enum.Enum`.

For example:

```python
class LeafyGreensField(StringField):
    alias = "leafy_greens"
    valid_choices = ("kale", "spinach", "chard")
```

or:

```python
class LeafyGreens(Enum):
    KALE = "kale"
    SPINACH = "spinach"
    CHARD = "chard"

class LeafyGreensField(StringField):
    alias = "leafy_greens"
    valid_choices = LeafyGreens
```

:::

### `ScalarField` (advanced)

Use this when you expect a single value, but it is a non-primitive type. For example, use this with any [`objects`](../macros.mdx) you defined.

You must set the class properties `expected_type` and `expected_type_description`. You should also change the type signature of the classmethod `compute_value` so that Pants can show the correct types when running `./pants help $target_type`.

For example:

```python
class DemoScalarField(ScalarField):
    alias = "demo_scalar"
    expected_type = MyObject
    expected_type_description = "a `my_object()` instance"

    @classmethod
    def compute_value(
        raw_value: Optional[MyObject], *, address: Address
    ) -> Optional[MyObject]:
        return super().compute_value(raw_value, address=address)
```

### `StringSequenceField`

Use this when you expect 0-n strings.

The user may use a tuple, set, or list in their BUILD file; Pants will convert the value to an immutable tuple.

### `SequenceField`

Use this when you expect a homogenous sequence of values other than strings, such as a sequence of integers.

The user may use a tuple, set, or list in their BUILD file; Pants will convert the value to an immutable tuple.

You must set the class properties `expected_element_type` and `expected_type_description`. You should also change the type signature of the classmethod `compute_value` so that Pants can show the correct types when running `./pants help $target_type`.

```python
class ExampleIntSequence(SequenceField):
    alias = "int_sequence"
    expected_element_type = int
    expected_type_description = "a sequence of integers"

    @classmethod
    def compute_value(
        raw_value: Optional[Iterable[int]], *, address: Address
    ) -> Optional[Tuple[int, ...]]:
        return super().compute_value(raw_value, address=address)
```

### `DictStringToStringField`

Use this when you expect a dictionary of string keys with strings values, such as `{"k": "v"}`.

The user may use a normal Python dictionary in their BUILD file. Pants will convert this into an instance of `pants.util.frozendict.FrozenDict`, which is a light-weight wrapper around the native `dict` type that simply removes all mechanisms to mutate the dictionary.

### `DictStringToStringSequenceField`

Use this when you expect a dictionary of string keys with a sequence of strings values, such as `{"k": ["v1", "v2"]}`.

The user may use a normal Python dictionary in their BUILD file, and they may use a tuple, set, or list for the dictionary values. Pants will convert this into an instance of `pants.util.frozendict.FrozenDict`, which is a light-weight wrapper around the native `dict` type that simply removes all mechanisms to mutate the dictionary. Pants will also convert the values into immutable tuples, resulting in a type hint of `FrozenDict[str, Tuple[str, ...]]`.

### `PrimitiveField` - the fallback class

If none of these templates work for you, you can subclass `PrimitiveField`, which is the superclass of all of these templates.

You must give a type hint for `value`, define the classmethod `compute_value`, and either set `required = True` or define the class property `default`.

For example, we could define a `StringField` explicitly like this:

```python
from typing import Optional

from pants.engine.addresses import Address
from pants.engine.target import InvalidFieldTypeException, PrimitiveField


class VersionField(PrimitiveField):
    alias = "version"
    value: Optional[str]
    default = None

   @classmethod
   def compute_value(
       cls, raw_value: Optional[str], *, address: Address
   ) -> Optional[str]:
       value_or_default = super().compute_value(raw_value, address=address)
       if value_or_default is not None and not isinstance(value, str):
           # A helper exception message to generate nice error messages
           # automatically. You can use another exception if you prefer.
           raise InvalidFieldTypeException(
                address, cls.alias, raw_value, expected_type="a string",
           )
       return value_or_default
```

    default = False


class UploadTimeout(IntField):
    """How long to upload (in seconds) before timing out.

    This must be between 10 and 300 seconds.
    """

    alias = "upload_timeout"
    default = 100

    @classmethod

              f"be between 10 and 300, but was {value_or_default}."
          )
      return value_or_default


# Example of subclassing a pre-existing field.
# We don't need to define `alias = sources` because the
# parent class does this already.
class FortranSources(Sources):
    default = ("*.f95",)
```
