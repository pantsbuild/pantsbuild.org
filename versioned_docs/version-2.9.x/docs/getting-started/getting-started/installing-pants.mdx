## Creating the launch script

Pants is invoked via a launch script named `./pants` , saved at the root of the repository. This script will install Pants and handle upgrades.

First, set up a minimal `pants.toml` config file to instruct the script to download the latest 2.9 release:

```bash
printf '[GLOBAL]\npants_version = "2.9.1"\n' > pants.toml
```

Then, download the script:

```bash
curl -L -O https://static.pantsbuild.org/setup/pants && chmod +x ./pants
```

Now, run this to bootstrap Pants and to verify the version it installs:

```bash
./pants --version
```

:::note Tip: add `./pants` to version control
We strongly recommend checking the `./pants` script into your repo. This will allow all users to use Pants without having to manually set up this script themselves.
:::

:::tip Upgrading Pants
The `./pants` script will automatically install and use the Pants version specified in `pants.toml`, so upgrading Pants is as simple as editing the version in that file.

## Running Pants from unreleased builds

To use an unreleased build of Pants from the [pantsbuild/pants](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants) main branch, locate the main branch SHA, set PANTS_SHA=\<SHA> in the environment, and run `./pants` as usual:

```bash
PANTS_SHA=22c566e78b4dd982958429813c82e9f558957817 ./pants --version
```

## Building Pants from sources

We currently distribute Pants for Linux (x86_64) and macOS.

If you need to run Pants on some other platform, such as Linux on ARM or Alpine Linux, you can try building it yourself by checking out the [Pants repo](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants), and running `./pants package src/python/pants:pants-packaged` to build a wheel.

## Running Pants from sources

See [here](../../contributions/development/running-pants-from-sources.mdx) for instructions on how to run Pants directly from its sources.
This is useful when making changes directly to Pants, to see how those changes impact your repo.
