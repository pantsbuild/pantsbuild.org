The core concepts of Targets and Fields.

---

The Target API defines how you interact with targets in your plugin. For example, you would use the Target API to read the `sources` field of a target to know which files to run on.

The Target API can also be used to add new target types—such as adding support for a new language. Additionally, the Target API can be used to extend pre-existing target types.

:::note v1 plugin author upgrading to the Target API?
These docs are written from the perspective of writing a brand new plugin using the Target API and v2 engine, rather than the perspective of already having a v1 plugin and writing bindings for your plugin. However, these docs are still relevant.

We recommend reading the docs in this order:

1. Skim this "Concepts" page. The main difference from V1 targets is that fields are the most important part of the Target API. Rather than defining your fields in the `__init__()` of your target, you create a new class for each field.
2. Read "Creating new fields". The majority of your bindings will be creating fields for each custom target you have.
3. Read "Creating new targets". This shows how to hook up the fields you created in the previous step and how to register your target in `register.py`.

While writing your binding, run `./pants help my_custom_target` to check that everything looks right.

See [here](https://gist.github.com/Eric-Arellano/f83dcb8cfb891afe6af50f4b15707894) for an example of writing a binding.

Please message us on [Slack](/community/members) if you have any questions or you would like help writing bindings! We are eager to help.

## Targets and Fields - the core building blocks

### Definition of _target_

As described in [Targets and BUILD files](../../using-pants/concepts/targets-and-build-files.mdx), a _target_ is a set of metadata describing some of your code.

For example, this BUILD file defines a `python_tests` target.

```python title="BUILD"
python_tests(
    sources=['app_test.py'],
    compatibility='==3.7.*'
    timeout=120,
)
```

### Definition of _field_

A _field_ is a single value of metadata belonging to a target.

In the above example, `sources`, `compatibility`, and `timeout` are all fields.

Each field has a Python class that defines its BUILD file alias, data type, and optional settings like default values. For example:

```python title="example_fields.py"
from pants.engine.target import IntField, StringField

class PythonInterpreterCompatibility(StringField):
    alias = "compatibility"

class PythonTestsTimeout(IntField):
    alias = "timeout"
    default = 60

```

### Precise definition of _target_: a combination of fields

Precisely, a target is a combination of fields, along with a BUILD file alias.

These fields should make sense together. For example, it does not make sense for a `python_library` target to have a `haskell_version` field.

In fact, it only takes 3 lines of code to [create a new target](./creating-new-targets.mdx):

```python title="plugin_target_type.py"
from pants.engine.target import Dependencies, Sources, Target, Tags

class CustomTarget(Target):
    alias = "custom_target"
    core_fields = (Sources, Dependencies, Tags)
```

Any unrecognized fields will cause an exception when used in a BUILD file.

### Fields may be reused

Because fields are stand-alone Python classes, the same field definition may be reused across multiple different target types.

For example, most target types have the `sources` field.

```python title="BUILD"
resources(
    name="files_tgt",
    sources=["demo.txt"],
)

python_library(
    name="python_tgt",
    sources=["demo.py"],
)
```

This gives you reuse of code ([DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself)) and is important for your plugin to work with multiple different target types, as explained below.

## A Field-Driven API

Pants plugins do not care about specific target types; they only care that the target type has the right combination of field types that the plugin needs to operate.

For example, the Python autoformatter Black does not actually care whether you have a `python_library`, `python_tests`, or `custom_target` target; all that it cares about is that your target type has the field `PythonSources`.

Targets are only used to get access to the underlying fields through the methods `.has_field()` and `.get()`:

```python
if target.has_field(PythonSources):
    print("My plugin can work on this target.")

timeout_field = target.get(PythonTestsTimeout)
print(timeout_field.value)
```

This means when creating new target types, the fields you choose for your target will determine the functionality it has.

## Customizing fields through subclassing

Often, you may like how a field behaves, but want to make some tweaks. For example, you may want to give a default value to the `Sources` field.

To modify a pre-existing field, simply subclass it.

```python
from pants.engine.target import Sources

class JsonSources(Sources):
    default = ("*.json",)
```

The `Target` methods `.has_field()` and `.get()` understand this subclass relationship, as follows:

```python
>>> json_target.has_field(JsonSources)
True
>>> json_target.has_field(Sources)
True
>>> python_target.has_field(JsonSources)
False
>>> python_target.has_field(Sources)
True
```

This subclass mechanism is key to how the Target API behaves:

- You can use subclasses of fields—along with `Target.has_field()`— to filter out irrelevant targets. For example, the Black autoformatter doesn't work with any plain `Sources` field; it needs `PythonSources`. The Python test runner is even more specific: it needs `PythonTestsSources`.
- You can create custom fields and custom target types that still work with pre-existing functionality. For example, you can subclass `PythonSources` to create `DjangoSources`, and the Black autoformatter will still be able to operate on your target.
