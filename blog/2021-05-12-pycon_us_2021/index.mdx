PyCon US, the largest Python conference in the world, is getting under way (online-only this year), and Pants has a strong presence this year!

- On Friday at 9:15 AM PDT Pants contributor [Benjy Weinberger](https://twitter.com/benjy) (that's me!) will be speaking about some of the cool and unusual ways we leverage Python in the Pants execution engine, in “Creating extensible workflows with off-label use of Python”.
- On Friday at 1:00 PM PDT Pants contributor [Eric Arellano](https://twitter.com/EArellanoAZ) will be speaking, in Spanish, about our experience interoperating Python and Rust, in “Cuándo usar extensiones nativas en Rust: rendimiento accesible y seguro”.
- On both Friday and Saturday from 11:00-12:00 PDT we'll be demoing “Fast, Friendly Python Builds With Pants” in the virtual expo hall.

You can still register for the conference [here](https://us.pycon.org/2021/registration/information/). It's only $100 for an individual registration or $150 for a corporate registration, and proceeds benefit the Python Software Foundation. Perhaps your employer will reimburse the cost of a ticket?

Please tell your friends and co-workers about our talks and demos, and come find us online at the conference!
