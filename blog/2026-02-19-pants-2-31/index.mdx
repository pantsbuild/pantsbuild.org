We are pleased to announce Pants [2.31.0](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/blob/2.31.x/docs/notes/2.31.x.md), the latest release of [Pantsbuild](https://www.pantsbuild.org/), the scalable and ergonomic build system. To update, set `pants_version = "2.31.0"` in your `pants.toml`. If you're not using Pants yet, [get started now](/2.31/docs/getting-started).

_Highlights in [2.31](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/blob/2.31.x/docs/notes/2.31.x.md) include_:

- 🔏 `pantsd` now preserves web proxy environment variables for environments with restricted internet access.
- 🏃 `shell_command` targets are now "runnable" by both the `run` goal and targets like `code_quality_tool`.
- 🐹 Go now compiles with trimpath for reproducible builds
- 🔬 `pex_binary` targets can now create fully executable binaries (that is, they "bring their own Python") by leveraging [The Science Projects](https://github.com/a-scie) and [Pex](https://docs.pex-tool.org/).
- 🧝 A new `pants.backend.experimental.nfpm.native_libs` backend that simplifies the handling of native Linux binary dependency management.
- 🐞 And a whole bunch of updates, bugfixes, and general improvements!

NOTE: [Following](/blog/2025/10/06/winding-down-macos-intel-support) [prior](/blog/2025/12/10/pants-2-30) [announcements](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/discussions/22711), Pants 2.31 does not provide `x86_64` (aka "Intel") macOS binaries. This flows from the [reduced support](https://github.com/actions/runner-images/issues/13046) from GitHub and continued movement in the macOS ecosystem. If you are interested in maintaining and resurrecting support for `x86_64` macOS binaries, please [reach out](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/discussions/22711).

Check out the [full release notes](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/blob/2.31.x/docs/notes/2.31.x.md) for the accumulation of all those little improvements.

Pants is an open-source project, and the changes are all contributed by our community. If you want to see something more in the next changelog, join us on [GitHub](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants) and become a [contributor](/stable/docs/contributions).

We also offer [formal sponsorship tiers for companies](/sponsorship), as well as individual sponsorships via [GitHub](/sponsors/pantsbuild). These help pay for the ongoing development and hosting costs, and are managed by the Pants Build non-profit organization.

Some Pants maintainers also offer [paid consulting](/spotlight/service-providers) for adopting and customizing Pants for your company's needs.
