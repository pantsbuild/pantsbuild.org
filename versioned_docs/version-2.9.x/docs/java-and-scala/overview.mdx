Pants's support for Java and Scala.

---

:::danger Java and Scala support is alpha stage
We are done implementing the core functionality for Pants's initial Java and Scala support ([tracked here](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/projects/22)). However, there are likely to be use cases that we aren't yet handling.

Please share feedback for what you need to use Pants with your JVM project by either [opening a GitHub issue](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/issues/new/choose) or [joining our Slack](/community/members)!
:::

:::note Example Java and Scala repository
Check out [github.com/pantsbuild/example-jvm](https://github.com/pantsbuild/example-jvm) to try out Pants's Java and Scala support.
:::

## Initial setup

First, activate the relevant backends in `pants.toml`:

```toml title="pants.toml"
[GLOBAL]
backend_packages = [
  # Each backend can be used independently, so there is no need to enable Scala if you
  # have a pure-Java repository (or vice versa).
  "pants.backend.experimental.java",
  "pants.backend.experimental.scala",
]
```

Then run [`./pants tailor`](../getting-started/getting-started/create-initial-build-files.mdx) to generate BUILD files. This will create `java_sources` and `scala_sources` targets in every directory containing library code, as well as test targets like `scalatest_tests` and `junit_tests` for filenames that look like tests.

```
❯ ./pants tailor
Created src/jvm/org/pantsbuild/example/app/BUILD:
  - Add scala_sources target app
Created src/jvm/org/pantsbuild/example/lib/BUILD:
  - Add java_sources target lib
Created tests/jvm/org/pantsbuild/example/lib/BUILD:
  - Add scalatest_tests target lib
```

You can run `./pants list ::` to see all targets in your project:

```
❯ ./pants list
...
src/jvm/org/pantsbuild/example/app:app
src/jvm/org/pantsbuild/example/app/ExampleApp.scala
src/jvm/org/pantsbuild/example/lib:lib
src/jvm/org/pantsbuild/example/lib/ExampleLib.java
tests/jvm/org/pantsbuild/example/lib:lib
tests/jvm/org/pantsbuild/example/lib/ExampleLibSpec.scala
```

### Firstparty dependencies

In many cases, the dependencies of your firstparty code are automatically inferred via [dependency inference](https://blog.pantsbuild.org/automatically-unlocking-concurrent-builds-and-fine-grained-caching-on-the-jvm-with-dependency-inference/) based on your `import` statements. If you do need to declare additional dependencies for any reason, you can do so using Pants' [syntax for declaring dependencies for targets](../using-pants/key-concepts/targets-and-build-files.mdx).

### Thirdparty dependencies and lockfiles

Thirdparty dependencies (i.e. those from repositories like [Maven central](https://search.maven.org/)) are also automatically inferred via dependency inference, but must first be declared once per repository as [`jvm_artifact` targets](../../reference/targets/jvm_artifact.mdx):

```python title="BUILD"
jvm_artifact(
    group="com.google.guava",
    artifact="guava",
    version="31.0.1-jre",
    # See the callout below for more information on the `packages` argument.
    packages=["com.google.common.**"],
)
```

Pants requires use of a lockfile for thirdparty dependencies. After adding or editing `jvm_artifact` targets, you will need to update affected lockfiles by running `./pants coursier-resolve`. The default lockfile is located at `3rdparty/jvm/default.lock`, but it can be relocated (as well as additional resolves declared) via the [`[jvm].resolves` option](../../reference/subsystems/jvm.mdx#section-resolves).

:::note Thirdparty symbols and the `packages` argument
To efficiently determine which symbols are provided by thirdparty code (i.e., without hitting the network in order to compute dependencies in the common case), Pants relies on a static mapping of which artifacts provide which symbols, and defaults to treating each `jvm_artifact` as providing symbols within its `group`.

The `packages` argument allows you to override which symbols a `jvm_artifact` provides. See the [`jvm_artifact` docs](../../reference/targets/jvm_artifact.mdx#codepackagescode) for more information.
:::

### `resource` targets

To have your code [load files as "resources"](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/lang/resources.html):

1. Add a `resource` or `resources` target with the relevant files in the `source` / `sources` field, respectively.
2. Ensure that [an appropriate `source_root`](../using-pants/key-concepts/source-roots.mdx) is detected for the `resources` target, in order to trim the relevant prefix from the filename to align with the layout of your JVM packages.
3. Add that target to the `dependencies` field of the relevant JVM target (usually the one that uses the JVM APIs to load the resource).

For example:

```toml tab={"label":"pants.toml"}
[source]
# In order for the resource to be loadable as `org/pantsbuild/example/lib/hello.txt`,
# the `/src/jvm/ prefix needs to be stripped.
root_patterns = ["/src/*"]
```

```python tab={"label":"src/jvm/org/pantsbuild/example/lib/BUILD"}
java_sources(dependencies=[":hello"])

resources(name="hello", sources=["hello.txt"])
```

```java tab={"label":"src/jvm/org/pantsbuild/example/lib/Loader.java"}
package org.pantsbuild.example.lib;

import com.google.common.io.Resources;

public class Loader {
  public static String load() {
    ... = Resources.getResource(Loader.class, "hello.txt");
  }
}
```

```text tab={"label":"src/jvm/org/pantsbuild/example/lib/hello.txt"}
Hello world!
```

## Compile code

To manually check that sources compile, use `./pants check`:

```
# Check a single file
❯ ./pants check src/jvm/org/pantsbuild/example/lib/ExampleLib.java

# Check files located recursively under a directory
❯ ./pants check src/jvm::

# Check the whole repository
❯ ./pants check ::
```

## Run tests

To run tests, use `./pants test`:

```
# Run a single test file
❯ ./pants test tests/jvm/org/pantsbuild/example/lib/ExampleLibSpec.scala

# Test all files in a directory
❯ ./pants test tests/jvm::

# Test the whole repository
❯ ./pants test ::
```

You can also pass through arguments to the test runner with `--`, e.g.:

```
# Pass `-z hello` to scalatest in order to test a single method
❯ ./pants test tests/jvm/org/pantsbuild/example/lib/ExampleLibSpec.scala -- -z hello
```

## Lint and Format

`scalafmt` and `Google Java Format` can be enabled by adding the `pants.backend.experimental.scala.lint.scalafmt` and `pants.backend.experimental.java.lint.google_java_format` backends (respectively) to `backend_packages` in the `[GLOBAL]` section of `pants.toml`.

Once enabled, `lint` and `fmt` will check and automatically reformat your code:

```
# Format this directory and all subdirectories
❯ ./pants fmt src/jvm::

# Check that the whole project is formatted
❯ ./pants lint ::

# Format all changed files
❯ ./pants --changed-since=HEAD fmt
```
