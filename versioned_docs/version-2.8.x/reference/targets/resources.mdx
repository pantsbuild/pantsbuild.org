Generate a `resource` target for each file in the `sources` field.

Backend: <span className="color--primary">``</span>

<span className={styles.options}>

## `tags`

<Field
    type_repr={`field.type_hint`}
>

Arbitrary strings to describe a target.

For example, you may tag some test targets with &#x27;integration_test&#x27; so that you could run `./pants --tag='integration_test' test ::` to only run on targets with that tag.

</Field>

## `description`

<Field
    type_repr={`field.type_hint`}
>

A human-readable description of the target.

Use `./pants list --documented ::` to see all targets with descriptions.

</Field>

## `dependencies`

<Field
    type_repr={`field.type_hint`}
>

Addresses to other targets that this target depends on, e.g. [&#x27;helloworld/subdir:lib&#x27;].

Alternatively, you may include file names. Pants will find which target owns that file, and create a new target from that which only includes the file in its `sources` field. For files relative to the current BUILD file, prefix with `./`; otherwise, put the full path, e.g. [&#x27;./sibling.txt&#x27;, &#x27;resources/demo.json&#x27;].

You may exclude dependencies by prefixing with `!`, e.g. `['!helloworld/subdir:lib', '!./sibling.txt']`. Ignores are intended for false positives with dependency inference; otherwise, simply leave off the dependency from the BUILD file.

</Field>

## `sources`

<Field
    type_repr={`field.type_hint`}
>

A list of files and globs that belong to this target.

Paths are relative to the BUILD file&#x27;s directory. You can ignore files/globs by prefixing them with `!`.

Example: `sources=['example.ext', 'test_*.ext', '!test_ignore.ext']`.

</Field>

## `overrides`

<Field
    type_repr={`field.type_hint`}
>

Override the field values for generated `resource` targets.

Expects a dictionary of relative file paths and globs to a dictionary for the overrides. You may either use a string for a single path / glob, or a string tuple for multiple paths / globs. Each override is a dictionary of field names to the overridden value.

For example:

```
overrides={
  "foo.json": {"description": "our customer model"]},
  "bar.json": {"description": "our product model"]},
  ("foo.json", "bar.json"): {"tags": ["overridden"]},
}
```

File paths and globs are relative to the BUILD file&#x27;s directory. Every overridden file is validated to belong to this target&#x27;s `sources` field.

If you&#x27;d like to override a field&#x27;s value for every `resource` target generated by this target, change the field directly on this target rather than using the `overrides` field.

You can specify the same file name in multiple keys, so long as you don&#x27;t override the same field more than one time for the file.
