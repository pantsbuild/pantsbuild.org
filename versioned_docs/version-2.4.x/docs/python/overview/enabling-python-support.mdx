How to enable Pants's bundled Python backend package.

---

:::note Example Python repository
See [here](https://github.com/pantsbuild/example-python) for examples of Pants's Python functionality.
:::

Enable the Python [backend](../../using-pants/concepts/backends.mdx) like this:

```toml title="pants.toml"
[GLOBAL]
...
backend_packages = [
  'pants.backend.python'
]
```

You should now see some new goals available:

```text title="Shell"
$ ./pants help goals
...

package       Create a distributable package.

repl          Open a REPL with the specified code loadable.

...

run           Runs a binary target.
...

test          Run tests.
```

:::note Have content in your `__init__.py` files?
Pants automatically uses all relevant `__init__.py` files, even if dependency inference does not include the files and you don't add it to the `dependencies` fields of your targets.

This works if you have empty `__init__.py` files, like most Python projects do; but if you have actual code in your `__init__.py` files, you should turn on this option in your `pants.toml`:

```toml
[python-infer]
inits = true
```

This option will cause Pants to infer "proper" dependencies on any ancestor `__init__.py` file. If you run `./pants dependencies project/util/foo.py`, you should see `project/__init__.py` and `project/util/__init__.py` show up. This will ensure that any of the `dependencies` of your `__init__.py` files are included.

:::caution macOS users: you may need to change interpreter search paths
By default, Pants will look at both your `$PATH` and—if you use Pyenv—your `$(pyenv root)/versions` folder when discovering Python interpreters. Your `$PATH` likely includes the system Pythons at `/usr/bin/python` and `/usr/bin/python3`, which are known to have many issues like failing to install some dependencies.

Pants will prefer new Python versions, like 3.6.10 over 3.6.3. Because macOS system Pythons are usually very old, they will usually be ignored.

However, if you run into issues, you can set the `interpreter_search_paths` option in the `[python-setup]` scope:

```toml
[python-setup]
interpreter_search_paths = [
    # This will use all interpreters in `$(pyenv root)/versions`.
    "<PYENV>",
     # Brew usually installs Python here.
    "/usr/local/bin",
]
```

See [here](./interpreter-compatibility.mdx#changing-the-interpreter-search-path) for more information.
