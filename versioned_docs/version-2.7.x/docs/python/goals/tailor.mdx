To generate BUILD file targets for new source files, use:

```bash
$ ./pants tailor
```

You can run this when you first integrate Pants into your codebase, and then run it again as you add source files.

The `tailor` goal will add `python_library` and `python_tests` targets as needed. It won't add other target types, such as `resources`, `files` or `pex_binary` targets; You must still provide those manually.

Note that the `tailor` goal never modifies or deletes existing targets. It only creates new BUILD files or appends to existing ones.

You may freely edit the targets emitted by `tailor` before adding them to your repo.
