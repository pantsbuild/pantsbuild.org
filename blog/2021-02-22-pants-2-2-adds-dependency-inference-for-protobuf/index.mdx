As of Pants 2.2, Pants now knows how to use dependency inference with Protobuf! This includes:

1. Protobuf imports of other Protobuf files
2. Python imports of generated Protobuf code, including gRPC.

As discussed [in our post on dependency inference](../2020-10-29-dependency-inference/index.mdx), Pants understands which files depend on which to offer fine-grained caching. If none of the inputs have changed, Pants can safely cache your builds like running tests and generating code.

With conventional scalable build tools, this fine-grained invalidation requires substantial boilerplate: maintaining BUILD files that explicitly declare every dependency. Instead, Pants uses _dependency inference_ to reduce this boilerplate by up to 90% by reading your code and figuring out the dependencies for you.

As of Pants 2.2, Pants now knows how to use dependency inference with [Protobuf](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/)! This includes:

- Protobuf imports of other Protobuf files.
- Python imports of generated Protobuf code, including gRPC.

While Pants currently only generates code with Protobuf, we are eager to work with [community members](https://www.pantsbuild.org/docs/community) to support other protocols like Apache Thrift.

### WTH is Pants?

Pants is a scalable build tool, meaning that it orchestrates the tools you use in a modern Python repository, like Black, Pytest, Protoc (Protobufs), and setuptools. Pants will run these and many other tools concurrently, and brings fine-grained caching with minimal boilerplate, including as your codebase scales up in size.

See [our blog post introducting Pants v2/](../2020-10-27-introducing-pants-v2/index.mdx).

## How it works

Pants will first look at your repository's code layout and your Protobuf and Python file names to develop a global mapping. For example, we know that `protos/project/models.proto` corresponds to the Protobuf import `project/models.proto` and the Python modules `project.models_pb2` and (possibly) `project.models_pb2_grpc`.

With this global mapping computed, Pants then parses the relevant files to extract their import statements and look up the corresponding owner, if any.

For example, given this Proto:

```protobuf
// protos/build/remote/execution/remote_execution.proto
package build.remote.execution;

import "build/semver/semver.proto";
import "google/api/annotations.proto";
import "google/rpc/status.proto";
import "google/protobuf/duration.proto";
```

Pants infers dependencies on the correct Protobuf files:

```shell-session
$ ./pants dependencies protos/build/remote/execution/remote_execution.proto
protos/build/semver/semver.proto
protos/google/api/annotations.proto
protos/google/rpc/status.proto
protos/google/protobuf/duration.proto
```

Pants will also understand Python imports of these Protobuf files, normalizing their full paths into Python module names:

```python
# src/py/project/app.py
import build.semver.semver_pb2
import google.api.annotations_pb2_grpc
```

```shell-session
$ ./pants dependencies src/py/project/app.py
protos/build/semver/semver.proto
protos/google/api/annotations.proto
```

As discussed in [our post on Pants's performance](../2021-02-01-fast-incremental-builds-speculation-cancellation/index.mdx), this inference is 1) very safe and 2) very fast. Because Pants invokes processes hermetically with a sandbox, failing to infer a dependency can never cause the wrong thing to be cached. Further, the inference is fast thanks to Pants's core being implemented in Rust, along with a daemon, parallelism, and very fine-grained invalidation.

## Trying out Pants

Using Pants ensures that your builds always use your up-to-date Protobuf codeâ€”no more need to manually invoke scripts! Further, thanks to Pants's fine-grained understanding of your project's dependencies, you will only ever generate the Protobuf files you actually need.

We optimized Pants to be easy to [add incrementally to existing repositories](https://www.pantsbuild.org/docs/existing-repositories), including an upcoming feature in Pants 2.3 to auto-generate BUILD files (stay tuned for a blog post!).

The [Pants community](https://www.pantsbuild.org/docs/community) would love to help you get started. [www.pantsbuild.org/docs](https://www.pantsbuild.org/v2.1/docs)
