## `source`

<Field
    type_repr={`str`}
>

A single file that belongs to this target.

Path is relative to the BUILD file&#x27;s directory, e.g. `source='example.ext'`.

</Field>

## `batch_compatibility_tag`

<Field
    type_repr={`str | None`}
    default_repr={`None`}
>

An arbitrary value used to mark the test files belonging to this target as valid for batched execution.

It&#x27;s _sometimes_ safe to run multiple `tsx_test`s within a single test runner process, and doing so can give significant wins by allowing reuse of expensive test setup / teardown logic. To opt into this behavior, set this field to an arbitrary non-empty string on all the `tsx_test` targets that are safe/compatible to run in the same process.

If this field is left unset on a target, the target is assumed to be incompatible with all others and will run in a dedicated `nodejs test runner` process.

If this field is set on a target, and its value is different from the value on some other test `tsx_test`, then the two targets are explicitly incompatible and are guaranteed to not run in the same `nodejs test runner` process.

If this field is set on a target, and its value is the same as the value on some other `tsx_test`, then the two targets are explicitly compatible and _may_ run in the same test runner process. Compatible tests may not end up in the same test runner batch if:

- There are &#x22;too many&#x22; compatible tests in a partition, as determined by the `[test].batch_size` config parameter, or
- Compatible tests have some incompatibility in Pants metadata (i.e. different `resolve`s or `extra_env_vars`).

When tests with the same `batch_compatibility_tag` have incompatibilities in some other Pants metadata, they will be automatically split into separate batches. This way you can set a high-level `batch_compatibility_tag` using `__defaults__` and then have tests continue to work as you tweak BUILD metadata on specific targets.

</Field>

## `dependencies`

<Field
    type_repr={`Iterable[str] | None`}
    default_repr={`None`}
>

Addresses to other targets that this target depends on, e.g. `['helloworld/subdir:lib', 'helloworld/main.py:lib', '3rdparty:reqs#django']`.

This augments any dependencies inferred by Pants, such as by analyzing your imports. Use `pants dependencies` or `pants peek` on this target to get the final result.

See https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.25/docs/using-pants/key-concepts/targets-and-build-files for more about how addresses are formed, including for generated targets. You can also run `pants list ::` to find all addresses in your project, or `pants list dir` to find all addresses defined in that directory.

If the target is in the same BUILD file, you can leave off the BUILD file path, e.g. `:tgt` instead of `helloworld/subdir:tgt`. For generated first-party addresses, use `./` for the file path, e.g. `./main.py:tgt`; for all other generated targets, use `:tgt#generated_name`.

You may exclude dependencies by prefixing with `!`, e.g. `['!helloworld/subdir:lib', '!./sibling.txt']`. Ignores are intended for false positives with dependency inference; otherwise, simply leave off the dependency from the BUILD file.

</Field>

## `description`

<Field
    type_repr={`str | None`}
    default_repr={`None`}
>

A human-readable description of the target.

Use `pants list --documented ::` to see all targets with descriptions.

</Field>

## `extra_env_vars`

<Field
    type_repr={`Iterable[str] | None`}
    default_repr={`None`}
>

Additional environment variables to include in test processes.

Entries are strings in the form `ENV_VAR=value` to use explicitly; or just `ENV_VAR` to copy the value of a variable in Pants&#x27;s own environment.

This will be merged with and override values from `[test].extra_env_vars`.

</Field>

## `tags`

<Field
    type_repr={`Iterable[str] | None`}
    default_repr={`None`}
>

Arbitrary strings to describe a target.

For example, you may tag some test targets with &#x27;integration_test&#x27; so that you could run `pants --tag='integration_test' test ::` to only run on targets with that tag.

</Field>

## `timeout`

<Field
    type_repr={`int | None`}
    default_repr={`None`}
>

A timeout (in seconds) used by each test file belonging to this target.

If unset, will default to `[test].timeout_default`; if that option is also unset, then the test will never time out. Will never exceed `[test].timeout_maximum`. Only applies if the option `--test-timeouts` is set to true (the default).

</Field>
