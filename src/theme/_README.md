This directory holds swizzled components.

These are components defined by Docusaurus which we've wrapped or ejected
(with the exception of `MDXComponents.js`) which is used to declare components which are globally
available (See https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features/react#mdx-component-scope).
