## `tags`

<Field
    type_repr={`field.type_hint`}
>

Arbitrary strings to describe a target.

For example, you may tag some test targets with &#x27;integration_test&#x27; so that you could run `scie-pants-linux-x86_64 --tag='integration_test' test ::` to only run on targets with that tag.

</Field>

## `description`

<Field
    type_repr={`field.type_hint`}
>

A human-readable description of the target.

Use `scie-pants-linux-x86_64 list --documented ::` to see all targets with descriptions.

</Field>

## `dependencies`

<Field
    type_repr={`field.type_hint`}
>

Addresses to other targets that this target depends on, e.g. `['helloworld/subdir:lib', 'helloworld/main.py:lib', '3rdparty:reqs#django']`.

This augments any dependencies inferred by Pants, such as by analyzing your imports. Use `scie-pants-linux-x86_64 dependencies` or `scie-pants-linux-x86_64 peek` on this target to get the final result.

See https://www.pantsbuild.org/v2.19/docs/targets for more about how addresses are formed, including for generated targets. You can also run `scie-pants-linux-x86_64 list ::` to find all addresses in your project, or `scie-pants-linux-x86_64 list dir` to find all addresses defined in that directory.

If the target is in the same BUILD file, you can leave off the BUILD file path, e.g. `:tgt` instead of `helloworld/subdir:tgt`. For generated first-party addresses, use `./` for the file path, e.g. `./main.py:tgt`; for all other generated targets, use `:tgt#generated_name`.

You may exclude dependencies by prefixing with `!`, e.g. `['!helloworld/subdir:lib', '!./sibling.txt']`. Ignores are intended for false positives with dependency inference; otherwise, simply leave off the dependency from the BUILD file.

</Field>

## `source`

<Field
    type_repr={`field.type_hint`}
>

A single file that belongs to this target.

Path is relative to the BUILD file&#x27;s directory, e.g. `source='example.ext'`.

</Field>

## `kotlinc_plugins`

<Field
    type_repr={`field.type_hint`}
>

The IDs of Kotlin compiler plugins that this source file requires.

The plugin must be defined by a corresponding `kotlinc_plugin` AND `jvm_artifact` target, and must be present in this target&#x27;s resolve&#x27;s lockfile.

If not specified, this will default to the plugins specified in `[kotlinc].plugins_for_resolve` for this target&#x27;s resolve.

</Field>

## `timeout`

<Field
    type_repr={`field.type_hint`}
>

A timeout (in seconds) used by each test file belonging to this target.

If unset, will default to `[test].timeout_default`; if that option is also unset, then the test will never time out. Will never exceed `[test].timeout_maximum`. Only applies if the option `--test-timeouts` is set to true (the default).

</Field>

## `extra_env_vars`

<Field
    type_repr={`field.type_hint`}
>

Additional environment variables to include in test processes.

Entries are strings in the form `ENV_VAR=value` to use explicitly; or just `ENV_VAR` to copy the value of a variable in Pants&#x27;s own environment.

This will be merged with and override values from `[test].extra_env_vars`.

</Field>

## `resolve`

<Field
    type_repr={`field.type_hint`}
>

The resolve from `[jvm].resolves` to use when compiling this target.

If not defined, will default to `[jvm].default_resolve`.

</Field>

## `jdk`

<Field
    type_repr={`field.type_hint`}
>

The major version of the JDK that this target should be built with. If not defined, will default to `[jvm].default_source_jdk`.

</Field>

## `experimental_provides_types`

<Field
    type_repr={`field.type_hint`}
>

Signals that the specified types should be fulfilled by these source files during dependency inference.

This allows for specific types within packages that are otherwise inferred as belonging to `jvm_artifact` targets to be unambiguously inferred as belonging to this first-party source.

If a given type is defined, at least one source file captured by this target must actually provide that symbol.
