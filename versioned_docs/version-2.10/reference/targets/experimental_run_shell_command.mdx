import Field from "@site/src/components/reference/Field";
import styles from "@site/src/components/reference/styles.module.css";

---

Run a script in the workspace, with all dependencies packaged/copied into a chroot.

Example BUILD file:

```
experimental_run_shell_command(
  command="./scripts/my-script.sh --data-files-dir={chroot}",
  dependencies=["src/project/files:data"],
)
```

The `command` may use either `{chroot}` on the command line, or the `$CHROOT` environment variable to get the root directory for where any dependencies are located.

In contrast to the `experimental_shell_command`, in addition to `workdir` you only have the `command` and `dependencies` fields as the `tools` you are going to use are already on the PATH which is inherited from the Pants environment. Also, the `outputs` does not apply, as any output files produced will end up directly in your project tree.

## `tags`

<Field
    type_repr={`field.type_hint`}
>

Arbitrary strings to describe a target.

For example, you may tag some test targets with &#x27;integration_test&#x27; so that you could run `./pants --tag='integration_test' test ::` to only run on targets with that tag.

</Field>

## `description`

<Field
    type_repr={`field.type_hint`}
>

A human-readable description of the target.

Use `./pants list --documented ::` to see all targets with descriptions.

</Field>

## `dependencies`

<Field
    type_repr={`field.type_hint`}
>

Addresses to other targets that this target depends on, e.g. [&#x27;helloworld/subdir:lib&#x27;, &#x27;helloworld/main.py:lib&#x27;, &#x27;3rdparty:reqs#django&#x27;].

This augments any dependencies inferred by Pants, such as by analyzing your imports. Use `./pants dependencies` or `./pants peek` on this target to get the final result.

See https://www.pantsbuild.org/v2.10/docs/targets#target-addresses and https://www.pantsbuild.org/v2.10/docs/targets#target-generation for more about how addresses are formed, including for generated targets. You can also run `./pants list ::` to find all addresses in your project, or `./pants list dir:` to find all addresses defined in that directory.

If the target is in the same BUILD file, you can leave off the BUILD file path, e.g. `:tgt` instead of `helloworld/subdir:tgt`. For generated first-party addresses, use `./` for the file path, e.g. `./main.py:tgt`; for all other generated targets, use `:tgt#generated_name`.

You may exclude dependencies by prefixing with `!`, e.g. `['!helloworld/subdir:lib', '!./sibling.txt']`. Ignores are intended for false positives with dependency inference; otherwise, simply leave off the dependency from the BUILD file.

</Field>

## `command`

<Field
    type_repr={`field.type_hint`}
>

Shell command to execute.

The command is executed as &#x27;bash -c &lt;command&gt;&#x27; by default.

</Field>

## `workdir`

<Field
    type_repr={`field.type_hint`}
    default_repr={`'.'`}
>

Sets the current working directory of the command, relative to the project root.

</Field>
