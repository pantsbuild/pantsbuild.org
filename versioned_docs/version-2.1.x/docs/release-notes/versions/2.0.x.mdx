Some highlights:

- The v1 engine is being removed in order to focus on providing excellent support for v2 language backends: for now, this means Python.
- Dependencies can now be automatically inferred (with manual corrections where necessary), avoiding significant BUILD file boilerplate.
- Pants is now more file-centric and less target-centric. Targets exist to apply metadata to files, but the unit of operation in most cases is a file. In particular, dependency inference happens at the file level.
- The dynamic UI now outputs results for `test`, `lint`, and `fmt` as soon as it has them, rather than waiting for everything to finish.
- Added MyPy support. See [typecheck](../../python/goals/typecheck.mdx).
- Added Python Coverage support. See [test](../../python/goals/test.mdx).
- `help` now outputs the current value and the derivation of that value. This replaces the `options` goal.
- Added gRPC and MyPy Protobuf support. See [Protobuf](../../codegen/protobuf-and-grpc.mdx).
