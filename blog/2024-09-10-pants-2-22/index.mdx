We are pleased to announce Pants [2.22.0](<(https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/tree/2.22.x/docs/notes/2.22.x.md)>), the latest release of [Pantsbuild, the scalable and ergonomic build system](https://www.pantsbuild.org/). To update, set `pants_version = "2.22.0"` in your `pants.toml`. If you're not using Pants yet, [get started now](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.22/docs/getting-started).

_Highlights in [2.22](<(https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/tree/2.22.x/src/python/pants/notes/2.22.x.md)>) include_:

- 🎛 A major re-implementation of the Pants [options system](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.22/docs/using-pants/key-concepts/options). See below for more!
- 🏠 Support for executing local processes within the repository itself (rather than in a sandbox) via the new [workspace environment](https://www.pantsbuild.org/stable/docs/using-pants/environments#in-workspace-execution-experimental_workspace_environment) feature.
- 🐍 Initial support for Python 3.13.
- 🛫 Ability to export Python tools [from their default bundled lockfiles](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.22/docs/using-pants/setting-up-an-ide#tool-virtualenvs).
- ☁️ Improvements in FaaS support, such as the ability to create cloud functions as directories, instead of .zip files.
- 🏷️ [`vcs_version`](https://www.pantsbuild.org/stable/reference/targets/vcs_version) always executes locally, so that it has the local git context, even when otherwise using docker environments.
- 📊 A new experimental SQL backend, with [SQLFluff](https://sqlfluff.com/) linter support.
- 🗃️ A new experimental [Makeself](https://makeself.io/) backend for creating self-extractable archives.
- 🫙 A [`deploy_jar_exclude_files`](https://www.pantsbuild.org/2.22/reference/subsystems/jvm#deploy_jar_exclude_files) option, to allow excluding irrelevant signature files from JAR files.
- 🗺️ Better understanding of self-type annotations in Scala dependency inference.
- 🎒 The ability to bundle `openapi_document` and its `openapi_source` dependencies into a single file, for consumption by other targets.
- 📈 And lots of smaller features, update, bugfixes, and general improvements

Check out the [full release notes](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/tree/2.22.x/docs/notes/2.22.x.md). Pants is an open-source project, and the changes are all contributed by our community.

In particular, please note the transition to the new options system.

If you do encounter discrepancies that you can't resolve on your own, please [reach out to us!](https://www.pantsbuild.org/community/getting-help).

We also offer [formal sponsorship tiers for companies](https://www.pantsbuild.org/sponsorship), as well as individual sponsorships via [GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/pantsbuild). These help pay for the ongoing development and hosting costs, and are managed by the Pants Build non-profit organization.

Pants 2.22.0 took longer than usual to stabilize, but we hope to get 2.23.0 out quite soon!

Pants wouldn't be possible without everyone who contributed to 2.22.0, including everyone who shared feedback on changes and who tested release candidates! Thank you very much!
