# Getting Help

How to engage with the Pants community.

---

The [Pants community](/community/members) is friendly, welcoming, and passionate about improving the craft of software engineering. If you need help with anything Pants-related, you've come to the right place. We'd love to hear from you!

## How to get help

Pants community members will do their best to answer any questions that are posed in a respectful way. General questions about Pants,
its features, language support, roadmap etc. are always welcome.

If you need help debugging a specific problem you're encountering in your repo, then we ask that you help us to help you by adhering to the following:

- First, do your best to solve the issue on your own. The Pants [source code](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants), [issue tracker](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/issues), and [documentation](https://pantsbuild.org)
are useful resources for this.
- If you're still stuck, and would like a Pants contributor to look at your problem, please provide a small public GitHub repo that reproduces the problem.
  The README.md in this repo should provide clear instructions on how to reproduce the problem, and the architecture and OS on which it can be reproduced.
  Posting code and config snippets to Slack is not a good alternative, as we won't know if they contain enough information to reproduce the problem.
  A self-contained repo is far more useful.
- Then [file an issue](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/issues/new/choose) that states the problem and the steps you've taken to attempt to solve it, and a link to the reproduction repo. If you find
  an existing issue that seems relevant, please link to it, or post directly to that existing issue if you're reasonably sure it describes the same problem.
- Then, feel free to reach out in the #general channel in Slack with a link to your issue, to kickstart the discussion.

Keep in mind that this community support is provided *voluntarily*. When you ask for help you're asking busy people to devote their valuable time to solving your problem.
You are far more likely to get a positive response if you demonstrate that you've put in the basic legwork first.

As an open-source project, we always appreciate a willingness to dive in and fix issues yourself, with our guidance.
This is how open-source projects grow and thrive!

If you would like your support requests to jump to have a greater guarantee of a timely response, or if you would like help directly in a private repo (under NDA)
we invite you to become a [sponsor](https://www.pantsbuild.org/sponsorship) of Pants. Various tiers of sponsorship include the privilege of such extra support attention from Pants maintainers.

## Where to get help

### Slack

The best place to become acquainted with Pants community members, exchange informal chat and ask questions is at the project's Slack. You can join using [this link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf9zgf-MXRnVDJbrVEST3urqneq7LCcy0zw8qU-GH4hPMn52A/viewform?usp=sf_link).

We encourage you to introduce yourself in the `#welcome` channel!

### Discussions

The best place to ask deeper, long-term technical questions or hold design discussions is via the project's [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants). While questions, feedback, and design discussions are equally welcome on Slack, _we encourage you to choose Discussions whenever it's likely other users would benefit from persistent access to the conversation_. GitHub Discussions is indexed by search engines, and its content is retained long-term, so this is opportunity to help your fellow Pants users by making it easier for folks to discover supplementary technical information beyond the [docs](https://pantsbuild.org/docs).

We encourage you to introduce yourself in the [`"welcome"`](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/discussions/categories/-welcome) category!

### Blog

Read [blog.pantsbuild.org](https://blog.pantsbuild.org/) to find elaboration on new features, tutorials, reveals of upcoming features, insights into what we're thinking about and working on, case studies, and behind-the-scenes interviews with Pants users and maintainers.

### Mailing list

You can join the `pants-devel@googlegroups.com` mailing list [here](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/pants-devel). This is used mostly for announcements and for us to solicit user feedback.

### GitHub Repository

Pants is an open-source software project, developed at [https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants).

If you discover a bug with Pants or have a feature request, feel free to [file an issue](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/issues). Please check first if a similar issue has already been filed; if it has, please comment so that we know to bump the issue in priority.

### YouTube

We also have a [Pants Build YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCcfCbDqtqlCkFEuENsHlbQ) with a variety of concise tutorials, introductions to core concepts, and tips. Subscribe to the channel to get notified of additions.

Have an idea or request for a future video topic? Bring it up on the Slack! We'd love to know what you're wondering about.
