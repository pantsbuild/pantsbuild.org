A MyPy plugin loaded through source code.

To load a source plugin:

```
1. Write your plugin. See https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/extending_mypy.html.
2. Define a `mypy_source_plugin` target with the plugin's Python file(s) included in the
    `sources` field.
3. Add `plugins = path.to.module` to your MyPy config file, using the name of the module
    without source roots. For example, if your Python file is called
    `pants-plugins/mypy_plugins/custom_plugin.py`, and you set `pants-plugins` as a source root,
    then set `plugins = mypy_plugins.custom_plugin`. Set the `config`
    option in the `[mypy]` scope to point to your MyPy config file.
4. Set the option `source_plugins` in the `[mypy]` scope to include this target's
    address, e.g. `source_plugins = ["pants-plugins/mypy_plugins:plugin"]`.
```

To instead load a third-party plugin, set the option `extra_requirements` in the `[mypy]`
scope (see https://www.pantsbuild.org/v2.0/docs/python-typecheck-goal). Set `plugins` in
your config file, like you&#x27;d do with a source plugin.

This target type is treated similarly to a `python_library` target. For example, Python linters
and formatters will run on this target.

You can depend on other targets and Pants&#x27;s dependency inference will add them to the `dependencies` field,
including any third-party requirements and `python_library` targets (even if their source files live in a different
directory).

Other targets can depend on this target. This allows you to write a `python_tests` target for
this code or a `python_distribution` target to distribute the plugin externally.

## `tags`

<Field
    type_repr={`field.type_hint`}
>

Arbitrary strings that you can use to describe a target. For example, you may tag some test targets with &#x27;integration_test&#x27; so that you could run `./pants --tags='integration_test' test ::` to only run on targets with that tag.

</Field>

## `description`

<Field
    type_repr={`field.type_hint`}
>

A human-readable description of the target. Use `./pants list --documented ::` to see all targets with descriptions.

</Field>

## `compatibility`

<Field
    type_repr={`field.type_hint`}
>

A string for Python interpreter constraints on this target. This should be written in Requirement-style format, e.g. `CPython==2.7.*` or `CPython>=3.6,<4`. As a shortcut, you can leave off `CPython`, e.g. `>=2.7` will be expanded to `CPython>=2.7`. If this is left off, this will default to the option `interpreter_constraints` in the [python-setup] scope. See https://www.pantsbuild.org/docs/python-interpreter-compatibility.

</Field>

## `dependencies`

<Field
    type_repr={`field.type_hint`}
>

Addresses to other targets that this target depends on, e.g. [&#x27;helloworld/subdir:lib&#x27;]. Alternatively, you may include file names. Pants will find which target owns that file, and create a new target from that which only includes the file in its `sources` field. For files relative to the current BUILD file, prefix with `./`; otherwise, put the full path, e.g. [&#x27;./sibling.txt&#x27;, &#x27;resources/demo.json&#x27;]. You may exclude dependencies by prefixing with `!`, e.g. `['!helloworld/subdir:lib', '!./sibling.txt']`. Ignores are intended for false positives with dependency inference; otherwise, simply leave off the dependency from the BUILD file.

</Field>

## `sources`

<Field
    type_repr={`field.type_hint`}
>

A list of files and globs that belong to this target. Paths are relative to the BUILD file&#x27;s directory. You can ignore files/globs by prefixing them with `!`. Example: `sources=['example.py', 'test_*.py', '!test_ignore.py']`.
