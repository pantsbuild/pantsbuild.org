How to generate Python from Protocol Buffers.

---

When you depend on a `protobuf_library` in a Python target (like a `python_library`), Pants will run the Protoc compiler to generate Python code that you can import and use like normal Python code.

:::note Example repository
See [the Python example repository](https://github.com/pantsbuild/example-python) for an example of using Protobuf to generate Python.

:::tip Benefit of Pants: generated files are always up-to-date
With Pants, there's no need to manually regenerate your code. Pants will ensure you are always using up-to-date files in your builds.

Thanks to fine-grained caching, Pants will regenerate the minimum amount of code required when you do make changes.
:::

## Step 1: Activate the Protobuf Python backend

Add this to your `pants.toml`:

```toml title="pants.toml"
[GLOBAL]
backend_packages.add = [
  "pants.backend.codegen.protobuf.python",
  "pants.backend.python",
]
```

This adds the new `protobuf_library` target, which you can confirm by running `./pants help protobuf_library`.

:::note Enable the MyPy Protobuf plugin
The [MyPy Protobuf plugin](https://github.com/dropbox/mypy-protobuf) generates [`.pyi` type stubs](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/stubs.html). If you use MyPy through Pants's [typecheck goal](../goals/typecheck.mdx), this will ensure MyPy understands your generated code.

To activate, set `mypy_plugin = true` in the `[python-protobuf]` scope:

```toml
[python-protobuf]
mypy_plugin = true
```

MyPy will use the generated `.pyi` type stub file, rather than looking at the `.py` implementation file.

:::caution Want to use other protocols, like Thrift?
Please message us on [Slack](/community/members) if you would like support for more protocols. We would be happy to either add support to the core Pants distribution or to help you to write a plugin.

## Step 2: Set up the `protobuf` and/or `grpcio` runtime libraries

Generated Python files require the [`protobuf` library](https://pypi.org/project/protobuf/) for their imports to work properly. If you're using gRPC, you also need the [`grpcio` library](https://pypi.org/project/grpcio/).

First, add `protobuf`—and `grpcio`, if relevant— to your `requirements.txt` (see [Third-party dependencies](../overview/third-party-dependencies.mdx)).

```text title="requirements.txt"
grpcio==1.32.0
protobuf>=3.12.1
```

Then, add the targets' addresses to the option `runtime_dependencies` in the `[python-protobuf]` scope. Pants will use this to automatically add the target(s) to the `dependencies` field for every `protobuf_library()` target you write.

```toml title="pants.toml"
[python-protobuf]
# Use the path to your 3rd-party requirements,
# e.g. `3rdparty/python:protobuf`.
runtime_dependencies = ["//:grpcio", "//:protobuf"]
```

## Step 3: Define a `protobuf_library` target

Wherever you create your `.proto` files, add a `protobuf_library`.

```python tab={"label":"project/example/BUILD"}
# `sources` defaults to `['*.proto']`.
protobuf_library()
```

```text tab={"label":"project/example/f.proto"}
syntax = "proto3";

package project.example;

message Example {
  ...
}
```

Pants will use [dependency inference](../../using-pants/key-concepts/targets-and-build-files.mdx) for any `import` statements in your `.proto` files, which you can confirm by running `./pants dependencies path/to/file.proto`. You can also manually add to the `dependencies` field.

If you want gRPC code generated, set `grpc=True`.

```python title="src/proto/example/BUILD"
protobuf_library(grpc=True)
```

## Step 4: Use the `protobuf_library` in your Python code

Now, you can import the generated Python module in your Python code. For example, to import `project/example/f.proto`, add `import project.example.f_pb2` to your code.

Pants's dependency inference will detect Python imports of Protobuf modules, which you can confirm by running `./pants dependencies path/to/file.py`.

If gRPC is activated, you can also import the module with `_pb2_grpc` at the end, e.g. `project.example.f_pb2_grpc`.

```python
from project.example.f_pb2 import HelloReply
from project.example.f_pb2_grcp import GreeterServicer
```

:::note Run `./pants export-codegen ::` to inspect the files
`./pants export-codegen ::` will run all relevant code generators and write the files to `dist/codegen` using the same paths used normally by Pants.

You do not need to run this goal for codegen to work when using Pants; `export-codegen` is only for external consumption outside of Pants.
:::

:::caution You likely need to add empty `__init__.py` files
By default, Pants will generate the Python files in the same directory as the `.proto` file. To get Python imports working properly, you will likely need to add an empty `__init__.py` in the same location, and possibly in ancestor directories. You do not need to add a `python_library()` target; Pants will automatically include the file.

See the below section "Protobuf and source roots" for how to generate into a different directory. If you use this option, you will still likely need an empty `__init__.py` file in the destination directory.
:::

## Protobuf and source roots

By default, generated code goes into the same [source root](../../using-pants/key-concepts/source-roots.mdx) as the `.proto` file from which it was generated. For example, a file `src/proto/example/f.proto` will generate `src/proto/example/f_pb2.py`.

However this may not always be what you want. In particular, you may not want to have to add `__init__py` files under `src/proto` just so you can import Python code generated to that source root.

You can configure a different source root for generated code by setting the `python_source_root` field:

```python title="src/proto/example/BUILD"
protobuf_library(
  python_source_root='src/python'
)
```

Now `src/proto/example/f.proto` will generate `src/python/example/f_pb2.py`, i.e., the generated files will share a source root with your other Python code.

:::note Set the `.proto` file's `package` relative to the source root
Remember that the `package` directive in your `.proto` file should be relative to the source root.

For example, if you have a file at `src/proto/example/subdir/f.proto`, you'd set its `package` to `example.subdir`; and in your Python code, `from example.subdir import f_pb2`.
