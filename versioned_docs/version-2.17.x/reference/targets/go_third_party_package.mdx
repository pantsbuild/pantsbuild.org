---

A package from a third-party Go module.

You should not explicitly create this target in BUILD files. Instead, add a `go_mod` target where you have your `go.mod` file, which will generate `go_third_party_package` targets for you.

Make sure that your `go.mod` and `go.sum` files include this package&#x27;s module.

## `tags`

<Field
    type_repr={`field.type_hint`}
>

Arbitrary strings to describe a target.

For example, you may tag some test targets with &#x27;integration_test&#x27; so that you could run `scie-pants-linux-x86_64 --tag='integration_test' test ::` to only run on targets with that tag.

</Field>

## `description`

<Field
    type_repr={`field.type_hint`}
>

A human-readable description of the target.

Use `scie-pants-linux-x86_64 list --documented ::` to see all targets with descriptions.

</Field>

## `dependencies`

<Field
    type_repr={`field.type_hint`}
>

Addresses to other targets that this target depends on, e.g. `['helloworld/subdir:lib', 'helloworld/main.py:lib', '3rdparty:reqs#django']`.

This augments any dependencies inferred by Pants, such as by analyzing your imports. Use `scie-pants-linux-x86_64 dependencies` or `scie-pants-linux-x86_64 peek` on this target to get the final result.

See https://www.pantsbuild.org/v2.17/docs/targets for more about how addresses are formed, including for generated targets. You can also run `scie-pants-linux-x86_64 list ::` to find all addresses in your project, or `scie-pants-linux-x86_64 list dir` to find all addresses defined in that directory.

If the target is in the same BUILD file, you can leave off the BUILD file path, e.g. `:tgt` instead of `helloworld/subdir:tgt`. For generated first-party addresses, use `./` for the file path, e.g. `./main.py:tgt`; for all other generated targets, use `:tgt#generated_name`.

You may exclude dependencies by prefixing with `!`, e.g. `['!helloworld/subdir:lib', '!./sibling.txt']`. Ignores are intended for false positives with dependency inference; otherwise, simply leave off the dependency from the BUILD file.

</Field>

## `import_path`

<Field
    type_repr={`field.type_hint`}
>

Import path in Go code to import this package.

This field should not be overridden; use the value from target generation.
