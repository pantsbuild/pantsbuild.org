# Updating Pants BUILD files programmatically

### Introduction

Working with a monorepository implies dealing with build metadata files that provide information about the source code and how it should be built. Pants build system uses `BUILD` files which are valid Python files and are evaluated using a Python interpreter as a list of statements. When adding support for Pants in a codebase, one can use the `./pants tailor` command which will generate the minimal `BUILD` files necessary to get started.

As the adoption of Pants goes on, you may want to update your `BUILD` files across some parts or throughout the whole monorepository. This can be the case when you'd like to update your [`python_sources`](https://www.pantsbuild.org/v2.9/docs/reference-python_sources) targets to enable/disable some code formatters or linters (for instance, by adding `skip_black` and `skip_flake8` arguments). Likewise, updating `BUILD` files may be necessary if you'd need to tag multiple `python_tests` targets by setting the `tags` argument.

Although in most cases Pants does not require you to declare the dependencies between targets (thanks to [dependency inference](../2020-10-29-dependency-inference/index.mdx#dependency-inference)), manually updating the `BUILD` files for any codebase of a decent size will get tedious rather soon which is why it is necessary to have appropriate tooling for updating the `BUILD` files programmatically.

### Modifying BUILD files by using source code refactoring tools

Since the `BUILD` files are valid Python files, it is possible to use an AST / CST (abstract or concrete syntax tree) based approach and refactor the target declarations. This is fairly easy given the low complexity of the files in question.

You may be already using some automated refactoring tools developed in the Python community for large refactorings of the source code. If not, you may explore some tools such as [rope](https://github.com/python-rope/rope), [redbaron](https://github.com/PyCQA/redbaron), [astor](https://github.com/berkerpeksag/astor), or [LibCST](https://github.com/Instagram/LibCST).

### Modifying BUILD files by using Bazel build tools

If your use case is rather simple, and you don't have enough resources to develop Python refactoring tools in house, you may want to look at the out-of-the-box tools that will let you update the `BUILD` files programmatically. Because `BUILD` files in Pants share a lot of syntax with the `BUILD` files used in [Bazel](https://bazel.build/), it is often possible to use the Bazel build toolchain to interact with the Pants `BUILD` files.

When adopting Pants incrementally, potentially for only a segment of the monorepository, you would create `BUILD` files only in the projects (i.e. directories) of interest. However, it may be the case that after you have already enabled Pants for a part of your monorepository, you'd like to have a more fine-grained control over the target declarations. For instance, you may want to edit `BUILD` files within one or more projects by modifying the current arguments values, adding new or removing existing ones.

When using the Bazel build tools, keep in mind that they reformat the `BUILD` files following the [Bazel formatting style](https://github.com/bazelbuild/buildtools/blob/master/buildifier/README.md) which may be not necessarily how you expect your `BUILD` files to be formatted. If you are migrating from Bazel to Pants, however, you may find it convenient to preserve the same, familiar formatting style of the `BUILD` files used in the monorepository. Either way, if you are already formatting the `BUILD` files using `black`, then you may take advantage of the
[`./pants update-build-files`](https://www.pantsbuild.org/v2.9/docs/reference-update-build-files) command which will format all `BUILD` files in your project using `black` (support for `yapf` will come in the future releases).

To modify the Pants `BUILD` files in your project, you can use [buildozer](https://github.com/bazelbuild/buildtools/blob/master/buildozer/README.md). This is how you would add additional arguments to all existing targets across your monorepository:

```shell-session
$ buildozer 'set skip_yapf True' 'set skip_mypy True' ///...:%python_tests
$ buildozer 'set skip_yapf True' 'set skip_mypy True' ///...:%python_sources
```

The input target declaration

```python
python_sources()
```

would be turned into

```python
python_sources(
    skip_flake8 = True,
    skip_mypy = True,
    skip_yapf = True,
)
```

If you run a Python formatter on the `BUILD` files afterwards, it would be formatted to something like below:

```python
python_sources(
    skip_flake8=True,
    skip_mypy=True,
    skip_yapf=True,
)
```

There are ways to have a more fine-grained control over what targets you'd like to run the editing command on, but you may need to consult the Bazel docs as the semantics of addressing a particular target or targets within a directory may differ
from the ones used in Pants. This command, for example, would update only `python_sources` targets within a single project directory:

```shell-session
$ buildozer 'set skip_yapf False' projectdir/subdir:%python_sources
```

### Querying the Pants BUILD files before running the editing commands

The `./pants peek` command would be of help if you would need to query your `BUILD` files for information necessary to update them (e.g. you want to update only those targets that have a particular argument set to a particular value). The `peek` command would also help you confirm that programmatic updates of the `BUILD` files succeeded and made the changes you wanted to make.

For instance, with a little help from [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) to parse JSON, this command would report all `pex_binary` targets that have something else than `/usr/bin/python3` as its `shebang`:

```shell-session
$ ./pants peek project-name:: | jq '.[] | select(.target_type == "pex_binary" and .shebang != "/usr/bin/python3")'
```

If you already have experience using `buildozer`, you may want to prefer using its querying functionality to learn more about `BUILD` files targets before running the editing commands. This command would print the `name` and the `dependencies` arguments for all `pex_binary` targets for a particular project:

```shell-session
$ buildozer 'print name dependencies' project-name:%pex_binary
```

Buildozer documentation has lots of code snippets that will help you learn how to update your `BUILD` files.
